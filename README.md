Expected to arrive on devices sometime in fall, Android 14 brings new features and APIs, as well as behavioral changes that might impact applications. The purpose of the developer preview is to help application developers learn about these changes and test their applications for compatibility issues. One of the security enhancements the platform update is set to bring is related to runtime receivers and builds on changes introduced in Android 13, when Google instructed developers to specify whether their application's registered broadcast receiver should be visible to other apps on the device.

[What is a Pentester?](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/what-is-a-pentester/)


> With the cost of data breaches at an all-time high, organizations are working to proactively identify areas of risk on the network. Using pentesters to conduct penetration (pen) testing is becoming more common. To protect themselves, businesses must know their risk areas before hackers find vulnerabilities. Organizations can lower their attack risk by protecting against weaknesses or eliminating them. The 2022 IBM Cost of a Data Breach found that data breaches cost an average of $4.35 million per breach, an increase of 12.

> Princeton CarbonWorks' high-end road wheels have to date focused primarily on aerodynamic performance, but with the debut of its new Alta 3532 model, the young brand is now trying to win the hearts (and wallets) of riders more focused on gram scales. Claimed weights vary a bit depending on the exact hubs and spokes used, but they're impressive whichever way you go, going as low as 1,094 g and topping out at 1,202 g – and that's for disc-brake carbon clinchers. Should you prefer tubulars, that brings you well below the 1 kg mark to just 950 g (claimed) per set.

> If you're shopping for a digital camera, sensor size is one of the first things you'll hear about. Chances are you've seen terms like 'crop sensor,' 'full frame,' and 'micro four-thirds' thrown around, but what do those terms actually mean? And is camera sensor size actually important? How Your Digital Camera Sensor Works A digital camera's sensor collects light and converts that light into an image.

> Intel's CPU roadmap is a bit murky. We've all seen various forms of it and generally know what to expect. However, in silicon manufacturing, many details are always TBD until the day it launches. For example, we know Meteor Lake will follow Raptor Lake, and Arrow Lake comes after that. The fly in the ointment is Meteor Lake might be mobile-only. If that happens, the true successor to Raptor Lake is Arrow Lake in 2024. Now a new leak suggests that is the case, and Arrow Lake will offer big gains across the board for desktop users, especially in efficiency.

> Metroid Prime is my favorite game of all time. It was the Super Mario 64 of Metroid , brilliantly ushering the sci-fi platformer series from 2D to 3D. Obviously, I was thrilled to hear about Nintendo's surprise release of Metroid Prime Remastered , which you can play right now. But I'll admit that I was a touch nervous to return to the game, which I hadn't played in years. Would it hold up? In my first hour with Remastered , the answer so far is definitely yes.  I was overcome by waves of nostalgia from the moment I booted up the game.

These organizations were multinational global institutions that operated in a plethora of countries. One of the challenges that was common in these organizations was ensuring we complied with each jurisdiction's information and cybersecurity regulations. In practice, that work involved managing relationships with, in some cases, more than 250 regulatory authorities, each of which came with its own expectations of standards for cybersecurity best practice.

> Hi everybody! I'm new here and would really appreciate your advice. My knowledge about hardware and customization is not that good. My old MacBook Pro from 2015 needs an upgrade, and I am looking at the new MacBook Pro 14'' with M2 Max. I use my MacBook for a lot of graphic design, video editing and sports analysis. All of them uses some quite heavy software that uses a lot of power. I need my new MacBook to be able to process videos etc. as fast as even possible, and I do really not like lagging or bad performance! My idea is to (hold on now) upgrade it almost as much as possible: - M2 Max with 12‑core CPU, 38‑core GPU, 16‑core Neural Engine - 96GB unified memory - 4TB SSD storage The price is not an issue for me (no, I am really not rich), because I am willing to invest in really good performance for the years to come.

> A few days ago, a US fighter jet shot down a Chinese spy balloon that had entered US airspace over the Atlantic Ocean. Why are spy balloons used as a substitute for satellites in intelligence gathering and surveillance missions? Spy balloons are huge blimps, each about the size of three buses, that float higher than commercial airliners or even higher than fighter and spy planes. But these balloons fly at a much lower altitude than satellites that are at a higher altitude in Earth orbit. Most commercial airliners float during their flights at an altitude of 40,000 feet, while the Chinese balloon was within American territory, floating at an altitude of nearly 60,000 feet, and was maneuverable and showed that it could change its course.

A new video by Max Tech (opens in new tab) put the 2023 Mac Mini with M2 Pro head-to-head with Apple's 2019 workstation PC, and the results are both shocking and not a little infuriating for those who dropped the down payment on a house's worth of cash to buy Apple's premier workstation just three years ago.

This involves building a project of their choice, then open-sourcing and sharing what they've learnt and demoing the project. Quite often the HOP demos are run on the EP's local machine, for various reasons: cost of hosting, complexity of infrastructure, lack of experience with DevOps, and to make it easier for the EP to spend more time on the project. At Commit we're always keenly focused on enhancing the Engineer experience, so we're motivated to offer EPs an easier and better way to showcase their projects and learnings.

Software Configuration Management (SCM) is used less today than Version Control Systems (VCS) is. A simpler still term - 'Source Control' - seems to be used more recently, too. Similarly, ‘trunk' and ‘branch', have not always been used as terms for controlled code lines that have a common ancestor, and are eminently (and repeatably) mergeable.

Yahoo, which is owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management since a $5 billion buyout in 2021, added that the move would enable the company to narrow its focus and investment on its flagship ad business called DSP, or demand-side platform.

> A week after Twitter made the announcement about shutting down free access to the API, the company said today that it will charge $100 per month for the basic tier of API. This will get developers access to a 'low level of API usage' — without specifying what that exactly means — and the Ads API. The company had planned to shut down free access to its API on February 9, and now it has extended this deadline to February 13. But with no details available around API pricing restructuring and access levels, this extension seems symbolic as developers won't be able to plan their changes.

The way of use is even different. Some teams dropped 4-5 teams in one breath just to acquire a player. The Bucks paid 5 teams to the Nets because of Jae Crowder, and the Eagles also used 5 teams to grab the Pistons. Saddiq Bey , the Lakers Thomas Bryant also made the Nuggets willing to pull out 3.

> Hi, I wanted to use the erase all content and features setting on my m1 air due to some suspicious behaviors, and I was just wondering if whether this was safe to do so due to the following circumstances. My school uses eduoram which is encrypted and secured wifi, but to get to this connection you have to first connect to the unencrypted http legacy network for it to prompt you to download an application that would essentially allow you to connect to the encrypted network. If I were to reset my mac, it would redownload mac os itself connected to the http legacy network upon setting it back up because I cant download the application to get on the encrypted network before the device is getting set up and the mac uses wifi to download the OS again.

> Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share Millions of people will carve out time this Sunday to watch Super Bowl 57, where the Philadelphia Eagles will hopefully cream the Kansas City Chiefs in Arizona's State Farm stadium.

Broadcast rights for the big game have fallen to Fox in 2023, and the company has made it surprisingly easy to tune in. You don't even need a TV subscription — the company will live-stream the Super Bowl free on FoxSports.

There are two aspects to a computer's power: the number of operations its hardware can execute per second and the efficiency of the algorithms it runs.

> The hope to see Castlevania reborn through the latest series that is concocted directly by Konami is likely to end in disappointment. But at least compared to other franchises, Konami still seems to be paying attention to this one franchise. It still exists as an animated series on Netflix which ends up coming in fantastic quality. The good news again? Konami doesn't seem to mind collaborating with other developers who are interested in working on content with it. Something that spawned a super cool collaboration with Dead Cells! Coming as a surprise last year, confirmation of the presence of Castlevania content as DLC for the super fun and cool rogue-like game – Dead Cells is indeed welcomed.

> Elon Musk's SpaceX company has performed a key test on its huge new rocket system, Starship. Engineers conducted what's called a "static fire", simultaneously igniting 31 out of 33 of the engines at the base of the vehicle's lower-segment. The firing lasted only a few seconds, with everything clamped in place to prevent any movement. Starship will become the most powerful operational rocket system in history when it makes its maiden flight. This could occur in the coming weeks, assuming SpaceX is satisfied with the outcome of Thursday's test.

With so much complexity in deploying Kubernetes, unwanted exposure tends to increase, making Kubernetes vulnerable to security threats and unauthorized access. Here, we'll discuss the top Kubernetes security challenges. Take a look! Kubernetes solves container issues by providing an extensible, declarative platform that automates the management of containers for high availability, resiliency, and scale. But, Kubernetes is a big, complex, fast-moving, and sometimes confusing platform that requires users to continually learn and acquire new skills.
