[Google Describes Privacy, Security Improvements in Android 14](https://www.securityweek.com/google-describes-privacy-security-improvements-in-android-14/)


> Google this week announced the availability of the first Android 14 developer preview and also shared details on some of the security and privacy improvements the platform update will bring. Expected to arrive on devices sometime in fall, Android 14 brings new features and APIs, as well as behavioral changes that might impact applications. The purpose of the developer preview is to help application developers learn about these changes and test their applications for compatibility issues. One of the security enhancements the platform update is set to bring is related to runtime receivers and builds on changes introduced in Android 13, when Google instructed developers to specify whether their application's registered broadcast receiver should be visible to other apps on the device.

[What is a Pentester?](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/what-is-a-pentester/)


> With the cost of data breaches at an all-time high, organizations are working to proactively identify areas of risk on the network. Using pentesters to conduct penetration (pen) testing is becoming more common. To protect themselves, businesses must know their risk areas before hackers find vulnerabilities. Organizations can lower their attack risk by protecting against weaknesses or eliminating them. The 2022 IBM Cost of a Data Breach found that data breaches cost an average of $4.35 million per breach, an increase of 12.

> Princeton CarbonWorks' high-end road wheels have to date focused primarily on aerodynamic performance, but with the debut of its new Alta 3532 model, the young brand is now trying to win the hearts (and wallets) of riders more focused on gram scales. Claimed weights vary a bit depending on the exact hubs and spokes used, but they're impressive whichever way you go, going as low as 1,094 g and topping out at 1,202 g – and that's for disc-brake carbon clinchers. Should you prefer tubulars, that brings you well below the 1 kg mark to just 950 g (claimed) per set.

> If you're shopping for a digital camera, sensor size is one of the first things you'll hear about. Chances are you've seen terms like 'crop sensor,' 'full frame,' and 'micro four-thirds' thrown around, but what do those terms actually mean? And is camera sensor size actually important? How Your Digital Camera Sensor Works A digital camera's sensor collects light and converts that light into an image. It's a small square positioned inside the camera body behind where the lens is attached, and is made up of tiny photoreceptors.

> Intel's CPU roadmap is a bit murky. We've all seen various forms of it and generally know what to expect. However, in silicon manufacturing, many details are always TBD until the day it launches. For example, we know Meteor Lake will follow Raptor Lake, and Arrow Lake comes after that. The fly in the ointment is Meteor Lake might be mobile-only. If that happens, the true successor to Raptor Lake is Arrow Lake in 2024. Now a new leak suggests that is the case, and Arrow Lake will offer big gains across the board for desktop users, especially in efficiency.

> Metroid Prime is my favorite game of all time. It was the Super Mario 64 of Metroid , brilliantly ushering the sci-fi platformer series from 2D to 3D. Obviously, I was thrilled to hear about Nintendo's surprise release of Metroid Prime Remastered , which you can play right now. But I'll admit that I was a touch nervous to return to the game, which I hadn't played in years. Would it hold up? In my first hour with Remastered , the answer so far is definitely yes.  I was overcome by waves of nostalgia from the moment I booted up the game.

These organizations were multinational global institutions that operated in a plethora of countries. One of the challenges that was common in these organizations was ensuring we complied with each jurisdiction's information and cybersecurity regulations. In practice, that work involved managing relationships with, in some cases, more than 250 regulatory authorities, each of which came with its own expectations of standards for cybersecurity best practice.

> Hi everybody! I'm new here and would really appreciate your advice. My knowledge about hardware and customization is not that good. My old MacBook Pro from 2015 needs an upgrade, and I am looking at the new MacBook Pro 14'' with M2 Max. I use my MacBook for a lot of graphic design, video editing and sports analysis. All of them uses some quite heavy software that uses a lot of power. I need my new MacBook to be able to process videos etc. as fast as even possible, and I do really not like lagging or bad performance! My idea is to (hold on now) upgrade it almost as much as possible: - M2 Max with 12‑core CPU, 38‑core GPU, 16‑core Neural Engine - 96GB unified memory - 4TB SSD storage The price is not an issue for me (no, I am really not rich), because I am willing to invest in really good performance for the years to come.

> A few days ago, a US fighter jet shot down a Chinese spy balloon that had entered US airspace over the Atlantic Ocean. Why are spy balloons used as a substitute for satellites in intelligence gathering and surveillance missions? Spy balloons are huge blimps, each about the size of three buses, that float higher than commercial airliners or even higher than fighter and spy planes. But these balloons fly at a much lower altitude than satellites that are at a higher altitude in Earth orbit. Most commercial airliners float during their flights at an altitude of 40,000 feet, while the Chinese balloon was within American territory, floating at an altitude of nearly 60,000 feet, and was maneuverable and showed that it could change its course.
