Meanwhile, Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers looked completely lost against the New Orleans Saints -- but didn't lose any ground in the NFC North because the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings and Detroit Lions each lost their opener, too.

Considering trading in a Samsung phone we have around the house for $800 off towards the iPhone 13 PM. I understand it is $800 credit spread over 24 months and fine print says that the credit will end either after $800 is given or when I terminate/pay off the phone. Say I want to get the iPhone 14 next year and still have $400 owed to me, does that credit disappear since I will have to pay off the 13 PM to upgrade to a 14? from what I understand you lose the credit and have to pay the balance as though there was no credit.

[Beko Telvo Duo TKM8961 Turkish Coffee Machine](https://global.techradar.com/en-ae/reviews/beko-telvo-duo-tkm8961-turkish-coffee-machine)


> While there are plenty of espresso makers out in the market, it's rare that you see a machine dedicated to making Turkish coffee. If you're a fan of this thick, strong brew, then the Beko Telvo Duo Turkish Coffee Machine is definitely something to have in your kitchen.What's impressive about it is that it makes enough Turkish coffee to serve six people, and while that might be great for larger gatherings, it's a bit of overkill if you just occasionally want a single cup. This also means that the machine is larger than most single-brew machines, so you'll need to have enough counter space to keep it handy.
