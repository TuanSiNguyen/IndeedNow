> While there are plenty of espresso makers out in the market, it's rare that you see a machine dedicated to making Turkish coffee. If you're a fan of this thick, strong brew, then the Beko Telvo Duo Turkish Coffee Machine is definitely something to have in your kitchen.What's impressive about it is that it makes enough Turkish coffee to serve six people, and while that might be great for larger gatherings, it's a bit of overkill if you just occasionally want a single cup. This also means that the machine is larger than most single-brew machines, so you'll need to have enough counter space to keep it handy.

During the Apple event, we got a new entry-level iPad, iPad mini 6, Apple Watch Series 7, and iPhone 13. While the Series 7 and iPhone 13 were definitely expected, I believe most of us were shocked that Apple decided to start off with the new iPad lineup.

> I wasn't sure what to expect from Kena: Bridge of Spirits. Developer Ember Lab's adorable adventure caused quite a stir when it was revealed at the PlayStation Future of Gaming showcase in 2020 Following a delay, it felt like Kena retreated into the shadows a bit - leaving some anxiety about whether it would still meet its new release date of September 21, and whether it would fall at the final hurdle many highly-anticipated releases have in the last couple of years.Developing a game in the current climate is a heavy cross to bear, particularly for a smaller studio like Ember.

> Source: Android Central I previewed Kena: Bridge of Spirits shortly before E3 2021. At the time, I only had an hour or so with the game, but felt confident that it was shaping up to be something special. After spending some more time with the final build, I'm happy that my initial impressions appear to be right. I haven't wanted to put the controller down since I started. Kena's characters and world hold such a charm that it's hard not to love them, and the gameplay continues to evolve throughout so that progression feels natural and earned.

Many models simply bump around, chaotically criss-crossing your floors until their battery runs low. This can result in clean floors, but you may find random spots that the vacuum completely missed, and these more basic robot vacuums may not always find their way back to their charging base to be ready for the next job (which could be needed right away if it missed a lot of spots).

> The Far Cry series has been no stranger to controversy. From criticism over Far Cry 4's cover art to the petition over Far Cry 5's portrayal of religious fanatics as villains, Ubisoft's long-running series is often contentious, to say the least, and Far Cry 6 is no different.Set on the fictional island of Yara, Far Cry 6 sees players taking on the role of Dani Rojas, who joins a guerrilla revolution against Yara's tyrannical dictator, Anton Castillo (played by Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito). It's a dark premise, but one that Ubisoft plans to balance with the chaotic, playground mechanics that the Far Cry series is known for – a balancing act that has already garnered criticism from some.

Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey recently analyzed seeds stuck in the footprints to determine their approximate age, ranging from around 22,800 and 21,130 years ago.The findings may shed light on a mystery that has long intrigued scientists: When did people first arrive in the Americas, after dispersing from Africa and Asia?Most scientists believe ancient migration came by way of a now-submerged land bridge that connected Asia to Alaska.

> It's time to take the first look at the recently introduced iPhone 13 series. The phones go on sale in India from today although we hear and see that the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max may hit the market only in limited quantity.

The price starts from Rs 69,990 and goes up to Rs 1,79,990.

He was citing David Leonhardt's New York Times newsletter. Biden and Leonhardt frame the statistic as encouraging: only 1 in 5,000. But it isn't good news or bad news. It's essentially meaningless. What's more important is knowing that when community spread of the coronavirus is high, the risk of breakthrough infection needs to be taken seriously, which means combining vaccination with other public health measures.

James Bond.'It's nearly six decades since Sean Connery first uttered those immortal words in Dr No, and 24 (official) movies and six actors later, the Bond series remains one of the most popular franchises in movie history.But with all those missions to choose from, working out how to watch the James Bond movies in order isn't quite as simple as it might seem. Sure, you could view them in release date order, but what if you prefer the quippy charm of Roger Moore to Sean Connery's more rugged portrayal of a government assassin? What if Daniel Craig, the current incumbent of the famous role, is your definitive 007? And what if you'd rather skip the more disappointing entries in the franchise entirely – A View to a Kill and Die Another Day, we have you in our sights…With the long-delayed 26th entry in the 007 series, No Time To Die, arriving in theaters on September 30 (UK)/October 8 (US), we've taken a tour through nearly 60 years of glamorous locales, femmes fatales and vodka martinis (shaken, not stirred, naturally) to explain how to watch the James Bond movies in order.

However, before you hand it over to someone else or drop it off at FedEx, there's still some work you'll need to do.

[Why are so few people actually using 5G in the U.S.? Here's what the experts say](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/5g-rollout-lagging-united-states/)


> Despite many devices boasting 5G capabilities these days, a recent study showed people in the U.S. spend less than 25% of their online time connected to a 5G network. This may be because 5G-enabled devices are outpacing 5G access. Last year, 14 million users subscribed to mobile 5G services, and the number was forecasted to grow to 554 million by the end of this year. Today, more than halfway into 2021, T-Mobile has already connected 305 million people with 5G networks. Along with T-Mobile, other major mobile operators like Verizon and AT&T were quick to roll out 5G in the last few months, collectively covering 75% of the U.

> So I am currently sharing my first video shot with cinematic video and thought I would share some thoughts and maybe spur some conversation. This was the absolute one feature I was looking forward to, and that with the "97%" more light back wide camera were enough to upgrade from my 12PM that I only got last December 26th. Just a few thoughts though. 1. Getting video off the phone is going to be a chore. In order to actually keep the depth effect, apple says you need to Airdrop or use the photos app, you cannot use iMazing or third party apps, the video just comes out as 1080p video with no depth effects.

At some point during the three-day spaceflight, an alarm alerted the four Crew Dragon passengers to an issue with — of all things — the toilet. A faulty space toilet may sound rather trivial when you consider other things that you really wouldn't want to go wrong while orbiting 357 miles (575 kilometers) above Earth. But the issue could've resulted in waste products floating around the spacecraft in the microgravity conditions, causing serious problems for those on board.

It follows a damning report by Facebook that revealed that Instagram was causing harm to the body image of young girls. According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal, internal documents from Facebook show the company was aware that it was having a detrimental affect on the mental health of teen girls.

> Source: Joe Maring / iMore Instagram owner Facebook has today announced plans to pause its planned Instagram Kids launch, allowing it time to build new parental supervision tools. In a press release penned by Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, Facebook says that it believes it's best to give kids access to a special version of Instagram, rather than them use the normal version. We firmly believe that it's better for parents to have the option to give their children access to a version of Instagram that is designed for them — where parents can supervise and control their experience — than relying on an app's ability to verify the age of kids who are too young to have an ID.

I have spent some time with all four models -- iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max -- but this review focuses on the standard iPhone 13 model.

Several users and Apple's partners, such as Verizon Communications Inc and Best Buy, have highlighted delays after pre-ordering began in September due to a shortage of supply and high demand, with analysts warning of one of the longest waiting times for the phone in recent years.

If the measure makes it to the November 2022 ballot and passes, drivers could end up earning as little as a quarter of the minimum wage, according to a University of California-Berkeley study published on Wednesday. The UC Berkeley Labor Center researchers, Ken Jacobs and Michael Reich, identified multiple loopholes that would change the guaranteed pay from $18 per hour to $4.

> If you're pondering the question of what makes for the best all-round gaming monitor, the new Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165 might just be the answer. On paper, at least.With a 32-inch 1440p panel running at up to 165Hz refresh, it arguably nails exactly the right balance between performance and graphical detail. Sure, there are gaming monitors with more pixels than the Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165. Others hum along at even higher refresh rates or offer more overall inches. But you quickly run into one obvious issue with ever-higher spec screens.

[Best 15-inch laptop 2021: top picks with 15-inch displays](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-15-inch-laptop)


> The best 15-inch laptops hit the sweet spot for most people between portability and practicality, making them ideal for business, school, or creative work on the go. They are often just as powerful as the best 17-inch laptop, while being able to fit into just about any backpack or tote bag when you're in a hurry as any of the best 13-inch laptops on the market right now.What's more, the best 15-inch laptops for gaming are also the smallest you can realistically get if you want to seriously game on the go, while productive users will find that anything less than 15 inches doesn't have the screen real estate to handle a moderately sized spreadsheet (and you can forget about that tenkey numpad on a 13-inch!).

The bladeless Haxson AirFan includes a heating mode, a formaldehyde sensor, and a purifier while maintaining a rather svelte profile. The HEPA filter should be able to stop contaminants like dust, smoke, pollen, and odor. On the audio side, the AirFan uses Bluetooth 5.0, and plays nice with both Alexa and Google Assistant. This allows you to ask the AirFan to dim its light, set an alarm, or answer inane trivia that's keeping you up in the middle of the night.

We'll show you how to opt in, set a predefined status, and set your custom status. How to turn on Chat in Gmail Right off the bat, if you don't have a chat tab at the bottom of Gmail, you do not have chat turned on yet, and you will not be able to set your status.

Several companies, including SpaceX and Amazon, have been working on similar tech, but have so far only been able to create connections by routing the satellite's signals through a physical terminal on Earth first.

The eruption is not in an area with homes and is entirely contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Officials said increased earthquake activity and ground swelling before the eruption put them on high alert. Fissures then opened in the summit area and sent lava fountaining into the sky. Now the area has filled with molten rock, creating a lake of lava in the volcano's crater. The new lava is an expected evolution of a volcano that is recharging after a huge eruption in 2018 drained much of its magma.

As for higher refresh rates, 144Hz and above, there seems to be very little demand for those (144/165Hz is typical of gaming hardware, both PC and smartphone).

However, as is common with high-profile iOS releases, iPhone users have been experiencing a highly annoying battery depletion problem following the introduction of iOS 15. According to a Tom's Guide article, the famous music streaming service Spotify could be to blame.

> E10 fuel economy: Drivers are being warned to save money by regulating their revs. Some drivers have expressed dissatisfaction with the new E10 gasoline's efficiency and fuel economy when compared to E5 gasoline. E10 gasoline has divided drivers since its launch in early September, with some hailing the environmental benefits and others noting that their car isn't as efficient. Using E10 gasoline reduces fuel economy by about 1%, however this is unlikely to be evident in ordinary driving. Other factors, such as driving style or driving with under-inflated tyres, have a far greater impact on fuel economy than the use of E10 gasoline.

> Ten years after Apple founder Steve Jobs' death, the company is a profit machine but some say it has lost its creative magic By Julie JAMMOT Ten years after Apple founder Steve Jobs' death, the firm has grown into a colossus of devices and services that is the world's most valuable company, but the tech legend's diehard fans lament its lost aura of revolution.

> It's starting to sound like the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro could be the most intriguing Pixel phones in a long time, with the company seemingly rebounding from its 2020 slump year that saw the less-than-interesting Pixel 4a, 4a 5G and 5.Even the recent Pixel 5a was a familiar-feeling phone, but by what rumors suggest - and what Google itself has said - the Pixel 6 range represents a big step up for the company.Google has officially revealed these handsets, and they look just like the leaks predicted: sleek devices with a visor-like camera block that splits the back cover in two.

The energy crisis that has engulfed most of Europe has generated tensions among EU member states.

Some member states have blamed Russia for limiting gas supplies on purpose, while others have blamed Brussels' ambitions for a green economic reform for the issue.

> If a company is hit with a major cyberattack, it may not be the only one that suffers. An organization's customers may also be vulnerable, and these attacks are hard to defend against. They are called supply chain attacks, in which, by attacking one major supplier, the hackers can reach its customers through striking less secure elements in a supply chain. One example is the cyberattack against the Israeli company Voicenter last month, which was hit by a group of foreign hackers. The cloud-based call center service provider counts companies like MobileEye, eToro, Check Point and Similar Web among its clients.

If you wait until Black Friday, the items that you purchase may not arrive on time, and they may even go on backorder if the product that you bought is a popular one.

[Best Squid Game memes: The show is serious, but these jokes are funny](https://www.cnet.com/news/best-squid-game-memes-the-show-is-serious-but-these-jokes-are-funny/)


> No doubt about it, the plot of the new Netflix drama, Squid Game, is nothing to laugh at. In the show, which might end up as the streaming service's biggest hit ever, financially strapped people compete in a tournament of kids' games where losers get killed. Not very funny. But the show has captured the public's imagination and as always, the memes and jokes have followed.  It's easy to see why -- Squid Game has many complex characters, as well as plenty of visually striking scenes and objects (the Dalgona cookies, the game organization's business card, the outfits).

However, there is no external source of revenue for those payoffs. Instead, the payoffs come entirely from new investment money, while the operators take away a large portion of this money. Investing in bitcoin (or any crypto with similar protocol) checks all these items. The investors are all those who have bought or will buy bitcoins; they invest by buying bitcoins, and cash out by selling them.

Generally speaking, the best iPhone game controller usually gives you better, well, control and can make playing for long stretches easier on mobile. That's why it's so upsetting that the game currently does not offer controller support. Can you use a controller in Pokémon Unite on iPhone and iPad? As ridiculous as it sounds, Pokémon Unite on mobile did not launch with controller support for either the iOS or Android versions.

But considering both tablets are about a year old with aging chipsets, we're eagerly anticipating when the new Galaxy Tab S8 will arrive. The last few Galaxy Tab S tablets were announced and launched in late summer, but Samsung is taking its time with the S8 series. This could be due to recent chip shortages, or because Samsung allegedly plans to release three new tablets this round, including a Tab S8 "Ultra" version that could go toe-to-toe with the iPad Pro in size and performance.

Physical games can be passed back and forth, but digital games technically stay connected to the Nintendo account and Switch console they were purchased on. If you buy a digital game on one Switch, it makes sense that you might want to share it on, say, your child's Switch for them to play. But is Gameshare possible? Technically, there is no official game-sharing service on Nintendo's systems.

Visa's neural network assesses more than 500 risk attributes in about a millisecond to predict every transaction's fraud probability. Data released by AusPayNet suggests it is working, as overall card fraud only rose 0.6% in 2020, even though online retail spending grew 44%. Enumeration attacks – an automated, brute force approach that guesses and tests payment credentials such as account numbers, CVV2, and/or expiry dates during online checkout – came to the fore locally and internationally during the past year.

A handful of other devices like the HP Elite Dragonfly Max business laptop also have 5-megapixel cameras but (a) they're likely to be 2-in-1 convertible laptops and (b) they still account for a tiny fraction of the market.So why is it that, in this day and age where hybrid working is all the rage, where Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Google Meet are household names and even mainstream smartphones (like the Infinix Zero 8) boast a selfie camera with 48-megapixel resolution, do laptop owners have to put up with VGA webcams (yes VGA)?VGA, for those below a certain age, refers to an antiquated, obsolete, bygone resolution of 640 by 480 pixels (or 307,000 pixels in all).

> TODAY'S BEST DEALSRemember when Sony cameras didn't even offer vloggers so much as an articulating screen? That wasn't long ago, but the Sony ZV-E10 is the latest in a growing line of video-centric Sony cameras that fixes this limitation, while neatly filling a gap between its entry-level (Sony ZV-1) and mid-range (Sony A6100) offerings.Like an A6100 spin-off with a video-tastic bod, the ZV-E10 is effectively two parts old internals and one-part new body, with a dash of souped-up software. What's even better is that this new entry wants to scratch your video itch without going over $1,000/ £1,000/ AUS $1,500 mark.

[Mystery of a strange mirrored double galaxy solved using Hubble data](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/hubble-mirrored-galaxy/)


> When telescopes like Hubble peer out into the cosmos, they can sometimes sneak a view of very distant objects using a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. This is where a massive object like a galaxy passes between a distant object and Earth, and the gravity of this intermediate object warps spacetime and acts as a magnifying glass. This allows astronomers to glimpse objects which would otherwise be too faint and far away to be visible. But sometimes these phenomena result in strange outcomes, like an oddity spotted by Hubble in 2013 which appeared to be two objects that were perfect mirror images of each other.

> A simple cooling system driven by the capture of passive solar energy could provide low-cost food refrigeration and living space cooling for impoverished communities with no access to the electricity grid. The system, which has no electrical components, exploits the powerful cooling effect that occurs when certain salts are dissolved in water. After each cooling cycle, the system uses solar energy to evaporate the water and regenerate the salt, ready for reuse. 'Hot regions have high levels of solar energy, so it would be very attractive to use that solar energy for cooling,' says Wenbin Wang, a postdoc in Peng Wang's lab.

Specifically, they would be adapting the terrors of the Spencer Mansion from Resident Evil 1. This raised several questions for me. Zombie games are plentiful. Horror board games investigating a mansion are abundant as well. So what exactly can Steamforged Games bring to a project that, adaptation of source material aside, do to help spice up such well-trodden formula and tropes?

> It's difficult for startups on a small budget to attract executives with the knowledge base to propel them forward, but Continuum, a talent marketplace for fractional employees, doesn't think it should be. The remote-first company, which launched today, has been quietly developing a tool that matches venture-backed companies with executives who have been-there-done-that, but don't want to be tied down again by a full-time position. Continuum was founded in 2020 by Nolan Church, former Carta chief people officer and DoorDash head of talent; Greg White, former Carta head of DevOps and security engineering; and Mary Nelson, former Voxer head of product and design.

> Lone Echo 2 will be the last major VR game released for the now discontinued Rift platform. With the Oculus Rift S having now been sunset, and the Facebook-owned company moving away from PC-only experiences entirely, we don't imagine another worthwhile title will wind up as an exclusive to the Oculus Rift store.It is perhaps ironic then that we chose to review this game using the Rift's successor, the Oculus Quest 2, connecting our headset to our PC through the wireless Air Link feature.No matter what Oculus device you choose though, this is a truly great VR game from developer Ready at Dawn - a team that definitely understands what the platform is capable of.

[Apple Watch 7's bigger screen: just how does it compare to older Apple Watches?](https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-watch-7s-bigger-screen-just-how-does-it-compare-to-older-apple-watches)


> (Image credit: TechRadar) One of the headline upgrades on the Apple Watch 7 is its larger screen, which is roughly 20% bigger than on the Apple Watch 6. That's achieved through a slightly larger body (41mm or 45mm compared to 40mm or 44mm) coupled with much smaller bezels of just 1.7mm.So although the Apple Watch 7 is larger on your wrist than the equivalent Apple Watch 6, we found in our Apple Watch 7 review that the difference is negligible, while the screen itself is quite a lot bigger here.

The iPhone 13 Mini, on the other hand, is a really petite smartphone, that is extremely powerful.

Yep, that's right, the classic FPS game is now playable on Twitter (provided youâ€™re good at coding and love trial and error).This isnâ€™t the first weird place weâ€™ve seen the game series crop up.

Still, you might be surprised to find out that it has never had its own branded wearable. We hear rumblings each year that Google is releasing a Pixel Watch, but it still hasn't. Revamps of its phone OS with Android 12 and the wearable platform with Wear OS 3, however, now means 2021 is the perfect time for Google to release a Pixel Watch. Samsung currently has a monopoly on the latest iteration of Wear OS with its recently launched Galaxy Watch 4 series and as great as Samsung is at many things, this smartwatch isn't shaping up to be the Wear OS savior many fans hoped for.

> Esperion Therapeutics Inc's (NASDAQ: ESPR) cholesterol drug marketing strategy has soured badly, as it has been struggling to sell its heart disease pill for more than a year. What Happened: The Company says it will cut about 40% of its staff over the next few weeks, or approximately 170 staffers are on the chopping block. The reductions are expected to save up to $80 million going into 2022. Esperion thought that with a cheaper pricing strategy, it could beat out the expensive PCSK9s Amgen Inc's (NASDAQ: AMGN) Repatha and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: REGN) Praluent.

> We had known that Apple was working on an all-new MacBook Pro based on Apple Silicon for quite a long time. I hadn't been particularly interested in the rumored machine because of the tremendously good M1 Macs that the company has been spinning out for about a year now. The new iMac is an incredible machine that's matched by a gorgeous design. Even the first M1 machines introduced last November are still very good and very fast computers. So I had no intention of buying a MacBook Pro today. Now if you know me, you're probably thinking 'this was inevitable' or 'of course he was going to buy one.

That made WhatsApp more akin to popular video chat apps like Zoom and Google Meet. Now you can join these group video calls directly from the chat tab.

> The Sony A7 IV is one of the most hotly-anticipated cameras of the past few years – and now the full-frame camera has landed, it's pretty clear to see why. On paper, it's shaping up to be one of the best mirrorless cameras you can buy. (Want to jump straight to our first impressions? Head to our hands-on Sony A7 IV review).The A7 IV is the successor to the Sony A7 III, a camera that arrived in March 2018 and immediately changed our expectations for entry-level full-frame cameras. The bad news is that the A7 IV will be pricier than its predecessor, costing $2,599 / £2,400 / AU$$4,299 (body only) when it becomes available from December (or late November in Australia).

The pandemic has accelerated this trend and made it harder for already stretched mental health services to deal with demand. Mental health hospitalisations among children have increased substantially during the pandemic, while mental health distress levels have doubled for young workers. While this data is startling, a lack of data is one of the key issues in the gaps we have in mental healthcare, much more-so than other chronic and acute healthcare issues.

> An assistant director unwittingly handed Alec Baldwin a loaded weapon and told him it was safe to use in the moments before the Hollywood actor fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, according to court records released late on Friday. A search warrant filed in a Santa Fe court revealed Baldwin was informed by the assistant that he was holding a "cold gun" on the set of the film "Rust." However, the gun was actually loaded with live rounds, and when Baldwin pulled the trigger on the set of his latest movie, he killed Hutchins.

"Come and manufacture in India, you (Tesla) will get all the tax benefits you want," he said while replying to a question about the company's demand related to tax concessions.

> Written by Adam Satariano and Paul Mozur Russia's boldest moves to censor the internet began in the most mundane of ways — with a series of bureaucratic emails and forms. The messages, sent by Russia's powerful internet regulator, demanded technical details — like traffic numbers, equipment specifications and connection speeds — from companies that provide internet and telecommunications services across the country. Then the black boxes arrived. The telecom companies had no choice but to step aside as government-approved technicians installed the equipment alongside their own computer systems and servers.

> Since the new standard of unleaded petrol was launched in the UK in September, drivers have been noting issues with their cars. E10 was introduced to replace E5 and move the country towards the Government's climate goals. E10 is blended with up to 10 percent bioethanol and thus releases less emissions, believed to cut transport CO2 emissions by 750,000 tonnes per year. However, some drivers have reported that the fuel has caused them to experience issues with their engines, resulting in higher fees for the driver.

> You can use Microsoft Office apps for free.  Josh Miller/CNET Whether it's for work or personal use, you'll probably need to access a Microsoft Word document, a PowerPoint presentation or other basic tools found in Microsoft 365 at some point. The service, formerly known as Office 365, offers more features than the average office software, but it can be costly. If you don't want to spend your money on Microsoft 365, don't stress. There are a few ways to get the service for free.  Microsoft's suite of productivity software -- which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Microsoft Teams, OneDrive and SharePoint -- typically costs $150 for a one-time installation (as Office 365), or between $70 and $100 every year for subscription service access across devices and family members (as Microsoft 365).

[前端小哥玩HTML复选框上瘾：能画logo做视频还开源成JS库](http://www.cnbeta.com/articles/tech/1194289.htm)


> 万万没想到，如此普通的复选框，竟也能玩出这种高度！例如点一下复选框，屏幕就像被投入石子的水面泛出波纹： 设定好初始状态，就可以开始展示《生命游戏》的演化过程；控制上下左右，还能还原经典游戏《贪吃蛇》；这就是一位做前端开发的小哥Bryan，近期在自己的网站上发布的有关checkbox（复选框）的新玩法。这个项目在Hacker News上引来了大量网友评论。高赞评论已经给小朋友安排得明明白白了~而面对一些诸如'为什么要用复选框，普通像素就可以达到这种效果'的质疑，也有人为Bryan说话：回到这件事本身，其实在去年早些时候，他就建了一个名为Checkboxland的JavaScript库。它可以将任何内容呈现为HTML复选框。还有更厉害的玩法讲真，刚才展示的复选框效果，只能说是'开胃菜'。不仅仅是简单的动画，日常拍下的照片，记录的生活vlog，一样可以成为'复选框'的素材。小哥本人也一度以为灵感耗尽，但在参阅了一篇关于将图像转化为ASCII的文章之后，Bryan将耐克和苹果的logo转化了出来（不建议转化迪士尼的logo）。小哥本人也是老二次元了，《Bad Apple》也是信手拈来：随后，自嘲'the CheckBox guy'的小哥赋予了复选框更多的可能，他又拓展了Checkboxland API，用来加载任何视频并生成复选框版本。下面这个看起来就像进入了《星际穿越》的五维立方体。而此刻你如果打开摄像头，Bryan还可以带领你半只脚踏进《黑客帝国》~赶快学起来，说不定还能用来画心形图，成为你的表白神器（不是）！复选框花式玩法，什么原理？看似炫酷的效果实际制作过程只需分为两大步，手把手教你！1.

Rockstar Games' Definitive Edition will offer quality-of-life improvements to all three of GTA's PS2 entries, including better aiming and reworked visuals, while retaining the original essence of GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas.

> The iPhone 13 brings new features like better cameras and longer battery life, but it's missing some capabilities.  Apple's iPhone 13 and 13 Pro certainly have a lot to offer over their predecessors: longer battery life, better cameras and more base-level storage space. While we loved the new cameras -- especially Cinematic mode -- there are plenty of features we had hoped to see on the iPhone 13 lineup but are missing from Apple's latest devices. Many of these capabilities are available on Android competitors, while some can be found on other Apple products.

> Abhilash Panda PortraitBy Abhilash PandaAkhilesh is an average 19-year-old boy in a small town in Rajasthan, who like any other youngster, apart from studying, likes to meet his friends, play online games and share notes on Tiger Shroff's latest story or the Badshah hit that has caught the fancy of the nation. He and his friends share memes, watch back-to-back reels and have their own little party going. All this while using their smartphones paired with a set of earbuds.One trip to the outskirts of any metro city in India and you will notice a strange phenomenon—youngsters sitting at market squares—or how we know them as 'mandis' —excitedly comparing their days' experiences with their friends with almost all of them wearing some or the other wearable device.

While the feature may be useful for some, it can also be a hindrance at times. When the autocorrect option is enabled, it can make it extremely difficult to type, as it can completely alter the word that you are looking to note down. In such cases, disabling the feature is a good idea, as it gives us more control on what we are typing.

It feels solid but lightweight, old-fashioned but uniquely modern. It's a study in opposites. With active noise canceling and Bluetooth connectivity, these have become my everyday drivers. We plugged them in when playing a game and switched to Bluetooth mode when we were out and about. The sound quality is rich, layered, and textured.

The comment, made on a call with investors this afternoon, speaks to Facebooks' concerns about declining usage among teens and young adults. 'So much of our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them, rather than specifically for young adults,' Zuckerberg said. TikTok is 'one of the most effective competitors we've ever faced' He suggested the change will be more than just lip service.

Patel soon stumbled upon equivalency tables, where universities track which courses from other institutions can be counted for credit during a transfer process. While seemingly innocuous, the tables gave him key data of where Boston University draws a line around accepting credits from other institutions – and where it contradicts itself. He eventually appealed to BU, a school I also attended, and pointed out that the university accepted credit from universities that accepted FIT's coursework.

> Many midrange TVs like this 60Hz Samsung Q60T are marketed with higher "motion" numbers. Geoffrey Morrison/CNET Refresh rate is one of the more confusing aspects of TV technology and TV makers don't do much to explain it. In fact, they often obscure it. Refresh rate is a number that specifies how many times per second the image on your TV changes. With most TVs it's 60, though it's rare you'll ever see a TV with that number listed. Instead, manufacturers use different technologies, such as the soap opera effect and black frame insertion, to claim a higher number.
