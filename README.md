> While there are plenty of espresso makers out in the market, it's rare that you see a machine dedicated to making Turkish coffee. If you're a fan of this thick, strong brew, then the Beko Telvo Duo Turkish Coffee Machine is definitely something to have in your kitchen.What's impressive about it is that it makes enough Turkish coffee to serve six people, and while that might be great for larger gatherings, it's a bit of overkill if you just occasionally want a single cup. This also means that the machine is larger than most single-brew machines, so you'll need to have enough counter space to keep it handy.

During the Apple event, we got a new entry-level iPad, iPad mini 6, Apple Watch Series 7, and iPhone 13. While the Series 7 and iPhone 13 were definitely expected, I believe most of us were shocked that Apple decided to start off with the new iPad lineup. While there were plenty of rumors for the new iPad mini, I don't think there were as many for the base-level iPad, which kicked off the event.

> I wasn't sure what to expect from Kena: Bridge of Spirits. Developer Ember Lab's adorable adventure caused quite a stir when it was revealed at the PlayStation Future of Gaming showcase in 2020 Following a delay, it felt like Kena retreated into the shadows a bit - leaving some anxiety about whether it would still meet its new release date of September 21, and whether it would fall at the final hurdle many highly-anticipated releases have in the last couple of years.Developing a game in the current climate is a heavy cross to bear, particularly for a smaller studio like Ember.

> Source: Android Central I previewed Kena: Bridge of Spirits shortly before E3 2021. At the time, I only had an hour or so with the game, but felt confident that it was shaping up to be something special. After spending some more time with the final build, I'm happy that my initial impressions appear to be right. I haven't wanted to put the controller down since I started. Kena's characters and world hold such a charm that it's hard not to love them, and the gameplay continues to evolve throughout so that progression feels natural and earned.

Many models simply bump around, chaotically criss-crossing your floors until their battery runs low. This can result in clean floors, but you may find random spots that the vacuum completely missed, and these more basic robot vacuums may not always find their way back to their charging base to be ready for the next job (which could be needed right away if it missed a lot of spots).

> The Far Cry series has been no stranger to controversy. From criticism over Far Cry 4's cover art to the petition over Far Cry 5's portrayal of religious fanatics as villains, Ubisoft's long-running series is often contentious, to say the least, and Far Cry 6 is no different.Set on the fictional island of Yara, Far Cry 6 sees players taking on the role of Dani Rojas, who joins a guerrilla revolution against Yara's tyrannical dictator, Anton Castillo (played by Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito). It's a dark premise, but one that Ubisoft plans to balance with the chaotic, playground mechanics that the Far Cry series is known for – a balancing act that has already garnered criticism from some.

Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey recently analyzed seeds stuck in the footprints to determine their approximate age, ranging from around 22,800 and 21,130 years ago.The findings may shed light on a mystery that has long intrigued scientists: When did people first arrive in the Americas, after dispersing from Africa and Asia?Most scientists believe ancient migration came by way of a now-submerged land bridge that connected Asia to Alaska.

> It's time to take the first look at the recently introduced iPhone 13 series. The phones go on sale in India from today although we hear and see that the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max may hit the market only in limited quantity. Now, before we talk about the phones just a line about their prices: Just like last year, this year also we saw four new iPhones iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. The price starts from Rs 69,990 and goes up to Rs 1,79,990.

He was citing David Leonhardt's New York Times newsletter. Biden and Leonhardt frame the statistic as encouraging: only 1 in 5,000. But it isn't good news or bad news. It's essentially meaningless. What's more important is knowing that when community spread of the coronavirus is high, the risk of breakthrough infection needs to be taken seriously, which means combining vaccination with other public health measures.

James Bond.'It's nearly six decades since Sean Connery first uttered those immortal words in Dr No, and 24 (official) movies and six actors later, the Bond series remains one of the most popular franchises in movie history.But with all those missions to choose from, working out how to watch the James Bond movies in order isn't quite as simple as it might seem. Sure, you could view them in release date order, but what if you prefer the quippy charm of Roger Moore to Sean Connery's more rugged portrayal of a government assassin? What if Daniel Craig, the current incumbent of the famous role, is your definitive 007? And what if you'd rather skip the more disappointing entries in the franchise entirely – A View to a Kill and Die Another Day, we have you in our sights…With the long-delayed 26th entry in the 007 series, No Time To Die, arriving in theaters on September 30 (UK)/October 8 (US), we've taken a tour through nearly 60 years of glamorous locales, femmes fatales and vodka martinis (shaken, not stirred, naturally) to explain how to watch the James Bond movies in order.

However, before you hand it over to someone else or drop it off at FedEx, there's still some work you'll need to do.

[Why are so few people actually using 5G in the U.S.? Here's what the experts say](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/5g-rollout-lagging-united-states/)


> Despite many devices boasting 5G capabilities these days, a recent study showed people in the U.S. spend less than 25% of their online time connected to a 5G network. This may be because 5G-enabled devices are outpacing 5G access. Last year, 14 million users subscribed to mobile 5G services, and the number was forecasted to grow to 554 million by the end of this year. Today, more than halfway into 2021, T-Mobile has already connected 305 million people with 5G networks. Along with T-Mobile, other major mobile operators like Verizon and AT&T were quick to roll out 5G in the last few months, collectively covering 75% of the U.

> So I am currently sharing my first video shot with cinematic video and thought I would share some thoughts and maybe spur some conversation. This was the absolute one feature I was looking forward to, and that with the "97%" more light back wide camera were enough to upgrade from my 12PM that I only got last December 26th. Just a few thoughts though. 1. Getting video off the phone is going to be a chore. In order to actually keep the depth effect, apple says you need to Airdrop or use the photos app, you cannot use iMazing or third party apps, the video just comes out as 1080p video with no depth effects.

At some point during the three-day spaceflight, an alarm alerted the four Crew Dragon passengers to an issue with — of all things — the toilet. A faulty space toilet may sound rather trivial when you consider other things that you really wouldn't want to go wrong while orbiting 357 miles (575 kilometers) above Earth. But the issue could've resulted in waste products floating around the spacecraft in the microgravity conditions, causing serious problems for those on board.

It follows a damning report by Facebook that revealed that Instagram was causing harm to the body image of young girls. According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal, internal documents from Facebook show the company was aware that it was having a detrimental affect on the mental health of teen girls. One section of the documents reportedly states: 'We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls'.

> Source: Joe Maring / iMore Instagram owner Facebook has today announced plans to pause its planned Instagram Kids launch, allowing it time to build new parental supervision tools. In a press release penned by Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, Facebook says that it believes it's best to give kids access to a special version of Instagram, rather than them use the normal version. We firmly believe that it's better for parents to have the option to give their children access to a version of Instagram that is designed for them — where parents can supervise and control their experience — than relying on an app's ability to verify the age of kids who are too young to have an ID.
