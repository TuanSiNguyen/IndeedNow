Essentially, Apple Music HiFi will provide a high-quality music experience to listeners.

> If you're excited for the new iPad Pro 2021, or perhaps one of the tablets we're expecting Apple to debut later in the year like the new iPad or iPad Mini 6, news probably hasn't escaped you of possible stock shortages (or perhaps news had escaped you, so we're sorry you had to find out this way).Word is that when each of the new iPads goes on sale, stock will be pretty limited - we've seen the same thing for PS5s, Xbox Series Xs and RTX 3090 graphics cards, and apparently iPads are next.If you're trying to buy one, then, you might find lots of retailers out of stock, or with units in just a few configurations, and if you try to order one there might be a several-month wait time.

> Bit o' background: While I've always loved computers and dabbled with web dev as a kid, I recently (6ish months?) started coding again hardcore. I had just had a business fail, money was tight as shit, debt to our eyeballs... and I wanted to start again with one of my oldest passions that I'd always been afraid to pursue. So I hunkered down and got into Python, because I remembered liking the language.I pretty quickly got a job in non-Python web dev (Angular and Node.Js, which I was competent enough in thanks to dabbling) but it was awful.

> The first film made such a splash that Aquaman 2 soon became inevitable. That's because the highest-grossing movie ever based on a DC Comics character doesn't belong to any of the famous trinity of Batman, Superman or Wonder Woman. Instead, the Jason Momoa-starring, James Wan-directed Aquaman beat them all – the new king of Atlantis was also crowned DC's king of the box office.It's something of a sea-change for a character who'd traditionally been the butt of the joke in comic-book circles – in everything from Family Guy to the fake James Cameron movie in Entourage.

The Amazon Echo Frames (Gen 2) may sound like another half-hearted attempt by a tech company to shove smart virtual assistants where they don't belong, further complicating and confusing our already crazy lives. But I'm here to tell you that these are actually pretty well thought out, designed, and implemented. After all, they've already been wear-tested for over a year by hundreds of nerds like me.

> Chances are, you or someone in your family has some old slides laying around. Wouldn't it be nice to have them in a digital format that you could share over email or display on your TV screen? We tested two different DIY ways to scan them in. One is a $140 digital scanner while the other is a free app called SlideScan. The app is unique in that all you need to scan your slides is your iPhone or Android. It works really well, but we found that the process is more time consuming and the final results could be hit or miss.

> In the real world – the world on which the global economy runs – we don't expose every aspect of our financial activity in public. We want to be able to select which parties can access our financial data and under what circumstances – for example, our credit history or bank transactions. The problem with the blockchain world is that this financial privacy doesn't really exist. This has led to pretty bad abuses, such as the practice of front-running' where a nefarious person can take advantage of you immediately after seeing your transaction on a public blockchain.

[Google is now rolling out the May update to supported Pixels](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_is_now_rolling_out_the_may_update_to_supported_pixels-news-48945.php)


> It's the first Monday of the month, and you know what that means? A Google update. Of Android. For its Pixel line. Well, those that are still supported anyway. We're talking Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G, and Pixel 5. That's the entire list. All of these devices aside from the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5 have build RQ2A.210505.002 headed towards them, while the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5 get build RQ2A.210505.003. As usual with Google updates, expect this one to take multiple weeks reaching all of the units out there in the wild, in a very staged rollout.

> At the center of the lawsuit is Fortnite, the hugely popular video game made by Epic that was kicked out of Apple's App Store last summer for flouting its rules on digital payments by establishing its own system. Apple (AAPL) gets a 30% cut of many in-app purchases on iOS devices and does not allow alternative payment systems. Fortnite's removal from the App Store prompted Epic to sue Apple. On day one, Epic and its first witness — the company's CEO, Tim Sweeney — sought to establish that Apple's App Store and its refusal to allow other app stores on its platform constitute anti-competitive behavior.

Skydio is best known as a pioneer of self-flying drone tech, but in recent years has shifted its attention away from a consumer market dominated by Chinese giant DJI to courting enterprise customers instead. This switch is partly due to geopolitics. The US government blacklisted various Chinese drones over spying fears last year, meaning law enforcement, military, and federal customers are looking more to US firms instead.

> OPINION: Is the App Store a monopoly? Something odd happened this week. Apple's stock price dropped nearly 5 per cent following impressive quarterly profits of US$1.40 a share versus the industry's estimate of US$0.98.In this February 5 photo, an Apple store employee wears personal protective equipment in New York. Closer analysis reveals that its revenue was up 66 per cent for iPhones, 70 per cent for Macs, 79 per cent for iPads, 25 per cent for wearables. This, to my simple mind, suggests that its share price should be going up, not down.

Although the stunt was covered by CBS News, BBC News, The Guardian, and others, it did actually make a significant point. By removing the physical piece, the group – calling itself 'Burnt Banksy' – proved that the value of the piece wasn't affected by being destroyed, given that the NFT went up so much in value.

While the anonymity of Craigslist is an appeal for some, being able to see who you are selling to or who you are buying something from is preferred by many people.  Historically, Facebook Marketplace has made it very easy to see who exactly you're buying from or selling to by including their full name and a link to their Facebook profile, but I noticed recently that there's been a change to the site's design.

Because if it's just ‘an Apple Watch', then the Apple Watch SE is an under-rated hit in the making, the better-value smartwatch to get with all the best perks at a great price.However, it doesn't manage to address the flaws that remain in Apple's smartwatch line, despite some notable advantages and a starting price of just $279 / £269 / AU$429. It offers the best of what you'd expect without offering anything new, so you'll be waiting on the fabled Apple Watch SE 2 for any big changes.

> Huawei P40 dealsThe Huawei P40 is a top phone with some fantastic hardware combined to make a stunning experience when it comes to camera, battery life, and a variety of other top-end features you'll want from a modern smartphone.Much like every recent Huawei phone, the P40 is hampered by its software. The Huawei ban in the US has restricted the Chinese company's use of the Google Mobile Services apps, so you're now left with a much more limited experience.That's mostly owing to the lack of Google Play Store functionality, and while the Huawei AppGallery - the company's alternative app store - does offer a number of apps, it's hard for Huawei to compete with the Google behemoth that many developers have flocked to for years.

One YouTuber decided to fix that by dismantling an AirTag and turning it into something much slimmer. Apple's AirTag is now here and it's generally been well received. But there's one problem that we just can't quite get away from – an AirTag is just too bulky to be put into a wallet. That is, it was until one YouTuber decided to fix all that.

As a result, not only do we get a pretty solid phone, whether you're buying it unlocked or with carrier incentives, but we also get a phone that punches above its price point in most categories. Battery life is great, performance is steady most of the time, and even the cameras do pretty decently during the day. The only downside is that the 120Hz screen doesn't get as bright as the competition. $500 at Samsung Larger 120Hz screen Great battery life Four years of security updates IP67 water resistance Tons of carrier incentives No mmWave support Screen washes out Weaker cameras, especially at night The middle child of Google's 2020 lineup is still a great option for 5G on a budget, and with a beefier processor than the A52 5G and support for mmWave on the Verizon model, the Pixel 4a 5G is the more pragmatic pick if you're going to be paying full price.

The Oculus Quest experience went beyond what was expected of a VR headset by being more than just affordable — it was as easy to use as a video game console. Since that launch, Facebook has acquired several VR game development studios, brought several developers onboard with its Oculus Store, and changed the paradigm of what people expect from the standalone VR experience.

However, the same mission that has helped it grow to a business valued at $2.4 billion with over 500 million registered learners, has led to tensions that continue to define the business. How do you survive as a startup if you don't want to charge users? How do you design a startup that isn't too hard to lose people, but isn't too easy to compromise education? How do you balance monetization goals while also keeping education as a product free? For my first EC-1, I spent months with Duolingo executives, investors, and of course, competitors, to answer some of these questions.

That seemed particularly likely when Mr Musk appeared to link his interest in the cryptocurrency to his appearance on the show, tweeting the date of his guest hosting spot and calling himself the 'Dogefather'.But the appearance also came after the Tesla and SpaceX boss urged people to exercise 'caution' when investing in cryptocurrencies.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and rapper Snoop Dogg. Dogecoin is itself an 'altcoin,' as cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin are often referred to, but there are now several imitators that are attempting to ride on the 'tailwind' of the frenzy surrounding the Musk-championed meme crypto.

> An out-of-control Chinese rocket has finally fallen to Earth over the Indian Ocean, according to organisations who had been tracking it.China's Long March 5B rocket was originally launched in late April to carry the first part of China's Tianhe module, which will serve as the core of its planned crewed space station. But the rocket booster itself went into orbit, and began an uncontrolled re-entry that led to fears it could come down above a populated area.It had been difficult to predict where or when the spacecraft might fall back down to Earth because of an array of unknown details, both about the rocket itself but also the way that the atmosphere would act on it.

The US Pentagon had been tracking the rocket body since last week but because of the unusual tumbling of the rocket body and its orbit it had been difficult to predict where -- exactly -- the huge piece of space junk would fall back to the planet.

Second place, though – at least if you ask me – has to go to the injustice of Tenet missing out on a nomination for Best Original Score. Ludwig Göransson (the composer of the toe-tapping theme to The Mandalorian you like so much) created an innovative, thrilling soundtrack that even goes backwards at key moments, to reflect the characters' own journeys through time in the film. Tenet's score is one thing about the Christopher Nolan's Bond-esque sci-fi thriller that I recommend unconditionally.

Jag hittade ett litet program vid namn AutoHDR som gör att det inte behövs. Det är skamligt att Microsoft inte fixat detta själva än. Förhoppningsvis kommer det en fix senare. https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e3e9816a4d0e7ddbb6bc30c6a8a2316349aa3718fad5a94ae37f9222dd1f4e79/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f436f646563746f72792f4175746f4844522f6d61696e2f53637265656e73686f74732f5374617475735f312d362d302e706e67 https://camo.

[Just wanted to share a failed experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/n8egb1/just_wanted_to_share_a_failed_experiment/)


> fileSo I was trying out a new method of data compression where the binary sequence of a file gets converted into a huge decimal number and is then represented as the product of two smaller ones the bit_length sum of which is smaller than that of the original number. The program uses trial and error to find a perfect divider who satisfies this condition so the process can take a while. The idea is that those two resulting numbers can be multiplied anytime to yield the original number and therefore the binary source of the compressed file, but unfortunately it doesn't work that way.

Apple, the maker of the iPhone, and Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, wrapped up the first week of testimony on Friday, with the iPhone inventor trying to fend off accusations from the video game developer that its App Store constitutes a monopoly and that it has engaged in anti-competitive behavior.

Host Elon Musk, playing himself, rushes to mission control when NASA's Mars mission goes horribly off the rails. Sacrifice will be necessary to save the crew, and a hero soon emerges in Chad. Musical guest Miley Cyrus also pops up as a fellow astronaut and soon-to-be baby mama to Chad's unborn child. But it's Musk who has the last laugh in the end when he throws back to his recurring IRL faux pas where he insists that "a bunch of people will probably die" once we embark on crewed missions to Mars.

Apple's AirTag was introduced during its April 2021 event. The AirTag is Apple's version of an item tracker that takes advantage of the Find My network to locate missing items.

Still, the V12 Detect Slim is expected to bring everything that's great about the V15 Detect, just in a slightly different and more affordable package.

Yet the phone costs just 200 British pounds, or about $280 at today's currency conversion rate, meaning that 5G is no longer only found on pricey mid- and high-specification phones. But cheap phones can also be substandard, especially when an 'expensive' feature like 5G gets slotted in to grab some headlines. The Realme 8 5G is cheap, but does it feel like it's cheap? MediaTek lends a hand How does Realme offer a phone with 5G for such a low price? One of the reasons is the phone uses a MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor, rather than a Qualcomm chip seen in mid-range smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G and the Google Pixel 4a 5G.

Last year's Mi Band 5 introduced a large OLED screen and a new charging connector, and for 2021 Xiaomi is rolling out a few upgrades with the Mi Band 6.

> Wing Although advances have clearly been made in recent years, there are still a number of obstacles preventing drone delivery services from going mainstream. Top of the list is, of course, safety, with regulators keen for clear proof that any autonomous aircraft flying overhead won't suddenly crash into an obstacle — or indeed each other — putting people on the ground in danger. Another problem that gets less attention is noise. If drone delivery really is to become a part of everyday life for urban communities, the companies developing such aircraft will have to make them much quieter or risk a backlash from those irritated by the buzzing rotors as the machines fly back and forth during delivery runs.

But AirPods' general lack of buttons makes this process feel more complicated than it is. Lucky for you, we know exactly how to accomplish it for the next time your pods won't connect, won't charge correctly, or are generally acting wonky.  Step 1: Put your AirPods in their case. The only button on the whole setup (which, spoiler, we will press) is on the case, so make sure the pods are nestled safely inside before continuing.

> Enlarge / The Apple M1 is a world-class processor—but it feels even faster than its already-great specs imply. Howard Oakley did a deep-dive investigation to find out why. Apple's M1 processor is a world-class desktop and laptop processor—but when it comes to general-purpose end-user systems, there's something even better than being fast. We're referring, of course, to feeling fast—which has more to do with a system meeting user expectations predictably and reliably than it does with raw speed. Howard Oakley—author of several Mac-native utilities such as Cormorant, Spundle, and Stibium—did some digging to find out why his M1 Mac felt faster than Intel Macs did, and he came to the conclusion that the answer is QoS.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 18 ― The rumours were true, and Apple has now confirmed that Lossless Audio will be coming to its streaming service in June 2021. Along with that, Apple Music will also support Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos — all of which will be offered to subscribers at no additional cost. This, as I previously mentioned, might just be the boost that the Cupertino-based company's music service needs, offering an edge over main rivals Spotify (who have yet to offer the lossless audio format).

[Together, Google and Samsung just may have a chance to beat the Apple Watch](https://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/google-samsung-together-may-beat-the-apple-watch/)


> At this moment in time, Apple owns the smartwatch space, and the Apple Watch's status as the world's bestselling watch is well-deserved. Google, on the other hand, has let Wear OS stagnate over the years, and while the dedicated companies that use Wear OS keep making great hardware, the software usually feels substandard. Samsung makes the only true competitor to the Apple Watch. The Galaxy Watch 3's fluid, well-designed Tizen software and innovative control system make it a winner, but it lacks Google apps and services.

> Microsoft founder Bill Gates reportedly 'pursued' several women in his office while married to his wife, Melinda French Gates, who is now estranged. Six women told the New York Times that Gates was known for making 'graceless' approaches towards women both inside and outside the office. On at least a few occasions, Bill Gates pursued women who worked for him at both Microsoft, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, according to a report by the New York Times. Six current and former staffers told the newspaper that the billionaire's questionable conduct created, at times, an uncomfortable workplace environment, and that Gates was known for making graceless approaches toward women, both in and outside of the office.

> The blobs are back in town. Google opened its I/O developer conference Tuesday with a performance that felt genuinely innovative, and actually fun, from the avant-garde vocal and electronica artist Tune-Yards  — and Google's own Blob Opera. The Blob Opera is an interactive Google Arts & Culture project from December 2020 that lets users create their own opera song, sung by animated blobs. Four opera singers spent hours in the studio recording operatic music. Their voices were assigned to four animated characters — called blobs — one each for soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, and bass, with the ability to harmonize and sing together due to the machine learning algorithm that powers the project.

If you desire a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro (2021), last year's case may not be a precise fit due to the 0.5mm thickness increase of the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro. You will need to buy a new case if you want it to fit perfectly. The new 3rd-generation 11-inch iPad Pro has the same dimensions as the previous 2020 model; therefore, if you have last year's model and are upgrading, you will not need to purchase a new case.

The wireless keyboard isn't just so your desk is spared one more cable, although it certainly looks the better for it. It's so you can move it around without snagging on something, put it on your lap if you need to, or type on the other side of the room if you fancy it (which might come in useful if you're using your computer screen as a TV and messaging friends at the same time).On the other hand, there are some situations where a cable is necessary: a gaming keyboard, for instance, needs that split-second speed advantage a wired connection offers and some bigger keyboards, especially ergonomic ones, use wires, too.

From the standard Amazon Kindle to the more premium Paperwhite and Oasis models, we expect not just discounts, but also bundles that include additional services like Kindle Unlimited for free. That means you can wrap up some serious value in this year's Prime Day Kindle deals, and looking at last year's offers we're likely to see a return to some record low prices on the devices themselves.

> TL;DR Realme has launched the Watch 2 Pro. It's essentially an upgraded version of the original Realme Watch 2. The smartwatch packs plenty of fitness tracking features, a large display, GPS, and a two-week battery. It's been a little over a month since Realme unveiled the Watch 2, its take on the budget fitness smartwatch. But for those wanting more from their wearable, the company has now unveiled the Realme Watch 2 Pro. Visually, the Watch 2 Pro doesn't differ much from its non-Pro sibling.

> When Privacy.com was founded in 2014, the company's focus was to let anyone generate virtual and disposable payment card numbers for free. The goal was to allow those users to keep users' actual credit card numbers safe while allowing the option to cut off companies from their bank accounts. In an age of near-constant data breaches and credit card skimmers targeting unsuspecting websites, Privacy.com has made it harder for hackers to get anyone's real credit card details. The concept has appealed to many.

[HP launches the new Omen 25i gaming monitor, starting at just $349](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/hp-omen-25i-gaming-monitor-starts-at-349/)


> Gaming monitors typically start at 27-inches, which is what makes the HP Omen 25i quite unique. The smaller 25-inch screen means a smaller overall footprint, which could make the Omen 25i a good option for college students or anyone with a compact desk. That also means this isn't an overly expensive monitor. The new Omen 25i costs $349. That's $70 more than the previous Omen 25, but it's still not overly expensive for a gaming monitor. That's especially true, considering the high-end design of this screen.

> Apple is blurring the line between the iPad and the Mac. With the company's messaging around higher-end iPad models referring to them as laptop replacements and the new iPad actually including the same chip as new Macs, there's no denying that it's harder than ever to decide which one to go for. Despite the similar processing power, Macs are still generally more capable than iPads, thanks largely to the desktop-class operating system — MacOS. But they're not better for everything. In fact, there are plenty of things that the iPad Pro is better at than the Mac.

While the outfit is backed by all the usual suspects, including endowments and pension funds, it's worth noting that around $130 million of that capital comes from investors and other employees inside of Bain, whose contributions typically make up 10% of a fund.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority said on Friday it found that in mid-2020, Telstra breached identity verification rules on at least 52 occasions, Medion Mobile on 53 occasions, and Optus on one occasion. ACMA Chair Nerida O'Loughlin said that under new rules introduced in early 2020, telcos must have more rigorous customer verification processes in place, such as multifactor or in-person identification.

I forked that old project since it hasn't been active since around 2016, and I reverse-engineered the decompiling for a lot of the new commands on the TI-84+ CE.

> A bipartisan group of lawmakers are introducing a bill Friday that would give states more control over which court hears antitrust lawsuits brought against companies, according to a copy of the proposal obtained by Axios.Why it matters: This bill would ensure that state AGs — which are suing companies more and more — get home-court advantage by choosing the court to hear the case and ensuring the case stays there.Between the lines: While the legislation may appear to be a narrow procedural change, it would give a big boost to the chances states' top enforcement arms have of winning antitrust lawsuits.

> (Image credit: Apple) The 7th-gen iPod touch we saw appear in 2019 was something of a surprise – before that, Apple hadn't refreshed its dedicated music player since 2015 – but apparently the pocketable jukebox isn't dead yet, with another model rumored to be on the way this year.That's according to MacRumors contributor @SteveMoser and tipster @AppleLe257 on Twitter, although they're keen to label this as a 'rumor' rather than a 'leak' – so it sounds like it's something that's been heard in passing from inside sources, rather than something there is hard evidence for.

> Startups used to be obsessed with billboards. It was the first thing I noticed when I moved to San Francisco: venture-backed companies including Eaze, Airbnb, and notoriously, Brex, would post large billboard advertisements all over the city to grab attention and eyeballs. When I dug into it more, I learned this type of old school, outdoor advertising was a response to the increasingly crowded online channels, such as Facebook and Instagram advertisements. Well, folks, years later, we have a new response to crowded marketing channels: Ditch the billboards and just buy a media company instead.

Lots of people invest in the latest gaming console or a great computer, keyboard and mouse, but they neglect one important factor: internet speed. If you're plagued by persistent lag while carrying out critical split-second decisions that make the difference between victory and defeat, a sluggish internet connection could be to blame.

Not to mention that some popular sound bars don't come with subwoofers. Creative tries to address all these points with the Carrier, and does it in a way that feels like it just works out of the box.

> The Sonos One is the best smart speaker you can buy. Despite being released a couple of years ago, it's a contender that's tough to overlook even with all the competition from big players such as Google, Amazon, and Apple. It's not often you find something that supports both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. Call it rare, which it is, but it also features fantastic sound for its size, support for Apple's AirPlay 2 wireless streaming, and — because it's a Sonos — it's a champ at multi-room audio, integrating with the rest of your Sonos setup right out the box.

> THE crypto market is in trouble again as China cracked down on coin mining and Bitcoin sat at just 50% of it all-time high on Sunday. However, a small rebound this morning saw Bitcoin's value rise from $32,000 to $36,000. The Ethereum, Cardano and Dogecoin currencies are also suffering though all three remain significantly up on where they were at the start of 2021. The market turmoil comes after China launched a cryptocurrency crackdown, which has led to top mining companies shutting down. Mining for cryptocurrency isn't actually a physical enterprise, rather it involves extremely sophisticated computers figuring out complicated maths problems in order to process crypto transactions.

While the program is a way to help lower costs while also promoting vaccinations in general, there are some points to be aware of before booking a ride, including how much riders can save and how to go about booking a free COVID-19 ride. Due to the various lockdown and stay-at-home orders that were issued, ride-sharing was one of the areas initially hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, services like Uber and Lyft were quick to make changes to ensure they continued serving local communities during the turbulent period, including delivering groceries, medicines, and other essentials.

We've seen a rumored Mac mini refresh that's about half the thickness of the Intel machines that still sell in the Apple Store. We even have an M1 in an iPad. So how thin – or how small – could Apple go? It's abundantly clear that much of Apple's design in recent years hasn't been about fitting components into a box.

This morning is no exception. Doximity filed to go public earlier today. You likely haven't heard of the company because it exists in the modestly obscure world of telehealth. But it's a venture-backed startup all the same that raised more than $80 million from investors like Emergence, InterWest Partners, Morgenthaler Ventures and Threshold, according to Crunchbase data.

[Is it worth the extra cost to buy Samsung's Galaxy Watch 3 with LTE?](https://www.androidcentral.com/should-you-buy-samsung-galaxy-watch-lte)


> Source: SamsungBest answer: Most people should buy the standard Bluetooth model of the Galaxy Watch 3. It's less expensive upfront and doesn't require an ongoing service with your carrier. Aside from streaming music and receiving calls independent of your phone, it does everything that the LTE model does — and has better battery life. The Galaxy Watch 3 is not a cheap device, starting at $339 for the 41mm Bluetooth model, but is the Galaxy Watch 3 with LTE worth it? The LTE models get an obvious price mark-up — that's whether you buy directly from Samsung or buy from a carrier like T-Mobile.

[Russian Authorities Tell Airlines To Expect Delays Due To Belarusian Airspace Ban](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/belarus/2021/belarus-210528-rferl03.htm)


> By RFE/RL May 28, 2021 Russia's state air transport agency says changes to routes from Europe to Russia as a result of the dispute between the West and Belarus over the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight to Minsk may result in longer clearance times. Rosaviatsiya said in a statement on May 28 that it had informed airlines to expect delays after Russia denied access to two European carriers that amended flight plans to skirt Belarus en route to Moscow. EU leaders have asked European carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace after the incident on May 23.

[Technology, health care firms propel stocks higher](https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/may/29/technology-health-care-firms-propel-stocks-higher/)


> Stocks capped a listless day of trading on Wall Street with modest gains Friday and the S&P 500's first weekly gain in three weeks. Gains in technology and health care companies outweighed a slide in communications stocks, retailers and elsewhere in the market. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% and notched a 1.2% gain for the week. The benchmark index closed out the final day of trading in May with a monthly gain of 0.5%. That's the index's fourth straight monthly increase and follows a bumpy few weeks in the markets as investors moved past a stellar corporate earnings season and focused on the tug-of-war between the economic recovery and rising inflation.

This year it's Man City vs. Chelsea in an all-English clash for all the marbles.  Who's the favourite? Based on current form, it's hard to pick against Man City. In their last outing they ripped Everton to shreds in a 5-0 drubbing. But anything can happen in football and, since sacking Lampard and bringing in Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea have looked and played like a different team -- a much better team.

[HOWTO: Configure a Python script to run on boot in Windows and macOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/nnt6jn/howto_configure_a_python_script_to_run_on_boot_in/)


> I'm working on a project that requires distributed data processing (no, not cryptomining... compiling public data from the federal government into some relational databases for personal use).As part of this task, I have a few dedicated machines on which I'd like to run a Python agent-type script as a background process. Notably, I want to run it on system boot, not within the context of a specific login. Some of these tasks run for multiple days (e.g., the main database is over a terabyte), and I don't want my actions of logging into or out of the machine to terminate the process and interrupt or ruin a bunch of work.

> A man rescued an iPhone 12 Pro from a canal in Berlin, but instead of diving in, he took advantage of MagSafe and fished for the smartphone. On Saturday, a friend of app developer Frederik Riedel dropped his iPhone 12 Pro into a canal in Berlin. At the time, it was thought the device was lost, as it sank into the mud at the bottom of the water. An initial attempt to rescue the iPhone where its owner waded through the 3-foot-deep mud failed, with seeming "no way to find it." As told on Twitter, Riedel and the friend instead went down the route of magnet fishing.

> So for those who don't play guitar or know anything about music in general here's a quick rundown:There are 12 notes in music and they go from A to G#, but they could really start anywhere as they will just repeat. Google musical notes for more info. As such there are 12 frets on a guitar to cover all 12 notes, and usually a guitar will go to 22 or 24 or even 29 frets. When you start at one note and go through all other 11 notes you will hit the same note but at a higher pitch, called an octave. So frets 1 & 13 on the same string are the same note but different octaves.

In the case of an AI-assisted disease detection, these shortcuts could lead to diagnostic errors if deployed in clinical settings, warn researchers.A team from the University of Washington in the US, examined multiple models recently put forward as potential tools for accurately detecting Covid-19 from chest radiography, otherwise known as chest X-rays.The findings, published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence, showed that rather than learning genuine medical pathology, these models rely instead on shortcut learning to draw spurious associations between medically irrelevant factors and disease status.

The arm performs station maintenance, moves supplies – and even astronauts – and performs 'cosmic catches' by grappling visiting crafts and bringing them to the ISS.The inspection, which took place on 12 May, found that the puncture came from a piece of space debris that was too small to be tracked – which accounts for rock or dust particles to flecks of paint from satellites, the CSA says.

Thanks to a limited-time offer at Costco Canada, the Moto G Fast is dropping even lower in price! Through June 6, customers can purchase the Moto G Fast on sale for just $159.

[iPad Mini 6 release date, price, news and leaks](https://www.techradar.com/news/ipad-mini-6)


> We expected the new iPad Mini 6 to get unveiled at Apple's spring event in April 2021, but that didn't happen - we got a new iPad Pro but no small-form tablets, which is a shame for people who wanted a new Mini.So when could we see the sixth-generation small-form iPad? We've no idea, but it probably won't be for a while - if the thing was ready to go, Apple would have announced it at the event. Perhaps it'll come out alongside the iPhone 13, in September, joining the new entry-level iPad in its usual slot.

Two SKUs for both an AMD Radeon W6800 and W6900X have been floating around for some time after being spotted in the source code of Mac, but most of the leaked information is exclusive to the W6800 so we're only expecting one GPU to be released initially.

> Everybody loves a good villain, right? Even though his adoptive brother took top billing in the original Thor movie, Tom Hiddleston's Loki was instantly the star attraction. This manipulative Norse god of mischief was always the kind of charismatic bad guy movie fans love to hate – even when he was giving Iron Man, Captain America and the rest the runaround in the original Avengers movie. That's why the new Loki TV show on Disney Plus is such an exciting proposition. Focussing on the Asgardian's Infinity Stone-powered exploits after escaping with the Tesseract in Avengers: Endgame, the six-part series will see Loki jumping through time, meddling with history.

"Compared to what the mobile operating systems expect, Python is big and slow. It uses a lot of battery charge, so if you're coding in Python you would probably very quickly run down your battery and quickly run out of memory," he said.

A lot of this is down to the Covid-19 pandemic closing offices, but people also found that conferencing software such as Zoom and Skype was useful for staying in contact with friends and family, all resulting in high demand for the little stock of good webcams available.

Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum and one of the industry's prominent thought-leaders, recently spoke at the Hong Kong's StartmeupHK Festival 2021 tech conference. Among many topics, Buterin shared his thoughts on Ethereum's hotly-anticipated shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). To the disappointment of many however, the shipping of shard chains is not expected until sometime in late 2022, according to Ethereum's latest roadmap.

They felt "actively ignored" by leadership, which claims people are eager to return to in-person collaboration, and wanted an option for full-time remote work rather than the planned twice a week.

> (Image credit: TSMC) The global semiconductor shortage is delaying the production of everything from refrigerators and microwaves to gaming consoles and smartphones. Experts are saying it could take months for the industry to recover, but in reality the shortage is changing consumer electronics forever.The industry has been reliant on silicon for decades, but the chip shortage is helping to make electronic devices more environmentally friendly, more efficient and smaller. More companies are turning to gallium nitride (GaN), because it is easier and faster to produce than silicon chips, among other benefits.

But as some nations now begin to unlock, there is little agreement over the conclusions that can be drawn.Eager to escape the confines of the home office, many people are calling for a transition to a hybrid working system, whereby time is split between the home, office and any other preferred location.Others, like Darren Murph, Head of Remote at GitLab, believe businesses are heading blindly towards catastrophe, having underestimated the logistical challenges a shift to hybrid working will create.

But at times those alone are not enough, especially if you follow the event-driven or serverless architecture and developing cloud-native applications. One of the most common use cases in such systems would be to scale workloads based on the number of messages in a queue/topic rather than CPU or memory.

That's iOS 14, and according to Apple, you can stick with it just fine. Even though Apple normally tries to push users towards updating, this year seems to be different. In fact, Apple not only says that users can stay on iOS 14 for the foreseeable, but it also says they'll receive security fixes while they do it.

Deckbuilders tend to be inherently self-balancing — adding more cards to your deck also means that you need more turns to draw cards, simultaneously increasing your options and reducing the likelihood of getting a particular card.

> Source: Daniel Bader / Android Central Following 2019's controversial Pixel 4, Google showed up to right its wrongs with the Pixel 5. The Pixel 4 introduced new ideas like a telephoto camera, face unlock system, and unique gestures, but it did so at the expense of battery life. This time around, Google's trying something a bit different. Rather than be concerned about having the highest-end processor or five cameras, Google designed the Pixel 5 to be a meat and potatoes Android phone that does everything you need it to do, has all of the core features you could ask for, and comes in at a much lower price than the latest flagships from Samsung and Apple.

As a practice that is proven to increase sleep quality, mental health, and symptoms of chronic pain, there has never been a better time to inject some calm into your daily routine post-pandemic. From remote workers to those of us still feeling anxious in the wake of Covid-19, mindfulness is a great way to aid the return to normal life. Studies have shown that those of us who practice at least one form of mindfulness a day have improved cognitive abilities, a wider attention span, and a more positive outlook on the world around them.

Still, we've already learned a ton about Android 12, and that's huge for fans looking forward to the Google Pixel 6.That's because the phone will likely be the first device to have the Android 12 operating system baked in: brand-new Android features will come to that phone first before trickling out to non-Google handsets. Older Pixel phones will almost certainly get the update at the same time, but it's possible – and based on the rumors, even likely – that the aging devices won't get all the new features that the Pixel 6 will get.

> (Image credit: Square Enix) The Final Fantasy series is going back to its roots once more. Revealed at E3 2021, Square Enix announced that it is planning remasters for not one, not two, but all of the first six Final Fantasy games. That's all the mainline games from the NES era through the SNES.Sadly, it was merely a tease of the companies plans, with no footage revealed. But these are formative games in the world-beating franchise, some of which are well-overdue a remake for modern audiences. And, in the case of some of the games, it's an opportunity for Square Enix to right the wrongs of some more half-hearted remasters that have blighted the series.

The result is obvious—higher sales.Now, imagine location intelligence being used to study trends across cities, assessing particular pockets and the time of the day when demand for transport is highest.

> Thorsten Wagner/Bloomberg Tech stocks could trump financials— and soon. The financial-market research firm Fundstrat made that call on Friday, saying it sees evidence that bond yields, the key to this trade, will stay low after retreating this spring. Fundstrat upgraded the FAANG stocks to Overweight from Underweight, a call that would work out if yields don't pick up. Lower bond yields boost the value of future cash flows. The FAANG companies— Facebook (ticker: FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google's parent, Alphabet (GOOG) are valued highly because they are expected to churn out increasing amounts of cash as they expand in various businesses in years to come.

But then Fesi got a nasty surprise: A month ago, he was abruptly vaccinated, and the vaccine made him sick. That's because the vaccine he got wasn't Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson.

The iPad mini may be getting a refreshed design that will make it look more like an iPad Air, according to a new leak. Apple hasn't updated its littlest tablet since 2019, so it would not be surprising for a new version to be released later this year.

With Apple pushing most of its products to a new level of performance, this all seems to suggest the new iPad mini will be the most exciting small tablet Apple's ever made.

But with Tesla's new Plaid Model S, Tesla hopes to change this reputation. Along with a higher quality build, Tesla has added noise cancelation technology. Microphones near the driver's and passenger's heads will detect road noise and then speakers in the same area will play a noise-canceling background sound to drown it out.

[25% of the GPUs sold in the first part of 2021 went to crypto miners](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/crypto-miners-bought-25-percent-of-gpus-in-2021/)


> Cryptocurrency mining was a major driving force of add-in board (AIB) graphics card sales in 2020, and that trend is continuing in 2021. A new report from Jon Peddie Research (JPR) says that miners purchased around 700,000 high-end and midrange cards in the first quarter of the year, totaling a market value of around half a billion dollars. JPR calculated the number of cards sold by using the trending attach rate of graphics cards and the actual attach rate of graphics cards. With data showing a clear spike in 2017 and 2018 — when the previous crypto boom happened — this model can tease out a fairly accurate estimate of how many graphics cards miners are purchasing.

Like GM's luxury brand Cadillac, Lincoln doesn't have an all-electric vehicle in its lineup.

After a long time, the tablet market has seen big growth as the global tablet shipment grew by 53% YoY in Q1 2021. According to a report from Counterpoint, a research firm, the global tablet market saw a big revival during the pandemic, emerging from a long slump. Not so unsurprisingly, Apple led the pack with more than one-third of the market share. (Image credit: Counterpoint)Since the schools and colleges are still running on the online-only model in many countries, the demand for large-screen devices saw a big jump in Q1 2021.

> On Wednesday, U.S. Congress approved a bill to make Juneteenth a national holiday, the vote passing with an overwhelming 415-14 majority. President Biden is scheduled to sign the bill into law this Thursday, officially setting aside June 19 to remember the day in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas were finally told they were free. However, considering the less than stellar reputation the Republican party has regarding issues of race and their recent push to ban critical race theory from schools, the enormous bipartisan support of the Juneteenth bill came as a surprise to some.

Now, three alums that worked with data in the world of big tech have founded a startup that aims to build a 'metrics store' so that the rest of the enterprise world — much of which lacks the resources to build tools like this from scratch — can easily use metrics to figure things out like this, too.

[James Corden and Marcus Rashford surprising kids while playing 'FIFA' is adorable](https://mashable.com/video/james-corden-marcus-rashford-surprise-kids/)


> Marcus Rashford is a very busy man. When he's not playing professional football for Manchester United or representing England at the Euros he's also campaigning to end child food poverty, launching his own book club and now, apparently, linking up with James Corden for a spot of online video gaming. In the clip above from The Late Late Show, Corden and Rashford take each other on in FIFA 21, before going up against (and largely getting beaten by) various groups of small children. The real highlight, though, is when they turn their cameras on at the end and the kids realise they've just scored a goal against Marcus Rashford himself.

When Google launched the original Pixel Buds in 2017, the reception was mixed to say the least. The earbuds were widely praised for their deep Google Assistant integration and good sound quality, but thanks to a truly awkward design and confusing charging case, they never really took off the way Google had intended.

That's why a portable battery charger or power bank is often a more practical purchase for your iPhone than battery cases, which increase battery capacity but tend to make a phone extra-heavy and bulky to carry around.To that end, I've rounded up the best portable power banks and battery chargers that will add a little extra oomph to your iPhone's battery life. Although they cost more, I personally like batteries that have a Lightning cable built into them, so I don't have to worry about carrying around a charging cable for fast charging when I don't have enough power.

The Asus Mouse MW203 is a wireless silent mouse that barely makes any noise and comes with features like a compact size, rubber grips on the side, back and forward buttons and a three-way DPI switch.

> Save $70: The Apple TV 4K (32GB, 4th gen) is on sale for $99 at Walmart as of June 21. Fire TV gear is one of Amazon's heavy hitters for Prime Day.  Walmart technically can't compete directly. It simply doesn't have a huge proprietary streaming platform like that. So it said fine — our version of a Prime Day streaming deal will be dropping the 32GB Apple TV 4K below $100. This 4th gen model doesn't have the nice, upgraded remote that Apple just released in April. But we can probably thank that new version for giving the go-ahead to such a juicy discount.

Summer is here, and we're pretty sure you'd rather be spending more time outdoors and less time in the kitchen so you can enjoy the weather. At least, that's how we feel. And for that reason, we're going to try to stock our kitchens with anything that will make the cooking process as fast and hands-free as possible. Perhaps the pinnacle of kitchen convenience in the Instant Pot, and as of June 20, you can pick up an Instant Pot Viva for $40 off at Walmart — that's almost as low as its Black Friday price, so it's not going to get much better than this.

> Volkswagen's Golf GTI is in a class of its own.But that doesn't mean it's the best hot hatch on sale, as the new Golf GTI takes a distinctly different road to turbocharged rivals.VW set the tone for the modern GTI with the fifth-generation model back in 2005. A turbocharged 2.0-litre engine and new dual-clutch automatic transmission contributed to a polished hatchback with a measured approach to performance.It introduced VW staples such as a flat-bottomed steering wheel with shift paddles, tartan seats, and subtle red or honeycomb-shaped highlights.

> Source: Stephen Warwick / iMore Apple TV+, Netflix, Disney+, and other streaming services could be forced to pump money into Canadian content as well as promote it on their services if a new law passes. According to Bloomberg, a controversial bill has already passed that seeks to regulate streaming services in the same way as local TV companies. If it becomes law, it will mean that international streaming services will have to play by Canadian rules and promote Canadian content. The legislation drafted by Justin Trudeau's government, known as Bill C-10, is meant to subject tech giants to the same requirements as traditional broadcasters -- effectively compelling companies like Netflix Inc.

> June 23, 2021 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Massive MIMO and virtual radio access network (vRAN) are two examples of how 5G architecture is fundamentally more complex than 4G. To make effective use and reduce the total cost of ownership of these new technologies, mobile operators and their vendors must leverage 'deep learning': a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). That's one takeaway MWC Barcelona 2021 attendees can learn from DeepSig.

[[Update] It's been forever, but Stadia finally works on Android TV](https://www.androidcentral.com/stadia-finally-comes-android-tv-and-chromecast-google-tv-june-23)


> Source: Android Central Over half a year after launching the Chromecast with Google TV, you'll finally be able to officially play Stadia games on it. On June 23, Stadia comes to the Chromecast with Google TV and a half-dozen Android TV devices. For non-supported Android TV devices, you'll still be able to play Stadia through an experimental opt-in. Stadia players will be able to use the Stadia controller or compatible Bluetooth controllers on Android TV. Source: Giphy One of the most glaring holes in the Chromecast with Google TV, when it launched back in October, was that it didn't support Stadia — you still had to spend more for the four-year-old Chromecast Ultra if you wanted to use Google's streaming game service on your TV.

[Prime Day monitor deals 2021: The best sales you can still shop](https://www.digitaltrends.com/dtdeals/best-prime-day-monitor-deals-2021/)


> Prime Day has sadly ended, but the sun hasn't set on all the best Prime Day deals. Plenty of bargains still remain and you've got a little bit of time left to shop — but if you need a new PC monitor and don't want to wait until Black Friday, you'll have to be quick on the uptake if you want to catch any of these post-Prime Day monitor deals before other shoppers snatch them up. Remember, though, that you're not stuck with Amazon if you want to get a good price on an awesome monitor. In fact, you don't even need a Prime membership to shop most of these Prime Day sales, because other outlets have their own discounts that are open to all (and some might even extend into tomorrow, although we don't recommend pushing your luck).

With the dog days of summer coming in hot, now's the perfect time to shop these remaining Prime Day smart thermostat deals, but now's not the time to dither. We've seen a few deals sell out already and don't want that to happen to you. The yearly Prime Day blowout is the best opportunity of the year (until Black Friday, anyway) to save on pricey electronics like smart home gadgets, and there are some great smart thermostat discounts right now if you're looking to smarten up your living space and save on energy bills as the summer arrives.

> Greetings fellow pythonistas!Most organizations that do not start their reporting operations without first deploying an ETL solution often use a chain of shell scripts that extract the data, do some transformation and produce some aggregated data that is stored in a database for future processing or send as xlsx or csv. This works fine for simple operations that have one or two steps of data extraction and transformation but it gets complicated and error prone when it needs to scale, There are easy to use ETL solutions like Luigi but they require time to convert the scripts to python code and a lot of testing as well.

These changes primarily translated to increasing the number of ACH or Direct Deposit payments made. According to Nacha—the governing body for the ACH network—business-to-business payments for supply chains, supplier payments, bills, and other transfers increased by almost 11% in 2020. But as organizations adopt electronic payment processes, there's another strategic opportunity for AP to consider: electronic credit card.

[HTC Vive Focus 3 review](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/htc-vive-focus-3)


> The Vive Focus 3 is the latest all-in-one virtual reality (VR) headset from HTC, successor to the Vive Focus Plus, and it's quite something to behold.It has a spec sheet to rival the previous generation of PC-powered headsets, with a combined 5K resolution across dual screens, 90hz refresh rate and 120 degree field of view (FOV). And yet, like its predecessor, the Vive Focus 3 is totally wireless, with all tracking and computing handled onboard.The screen is remarkably crisp and the performance smooth, but for a few dips here and there.

> (Image credit: Microsoft) Microsoft announced during its official reveal event on June 24 that the new OS will be bringing Android apps to the upcoming Windows 11. The apps will be supported via the Amazon App Store but will be locally installed and you can integrate them into the start menu or taskbar. There wasn't much information given about this surprise addition to Windows 11 during its fleeting announcement, but further information will likely appear in the coming days. What we've seen so far is that the apps can be tiled as part of the new application placement UI, with a demonstration showing TikTok running in its own dedication window on the desktop.

> Source: Nick Sutrich / Android CentralBest answer: No, not yet. Android phones will not be updated to support 6GHz Wi-Fi 6E unless they ship with support. Some PC expansion cards are available, but neither Windows 10 nor MacOS support 6GHz bands yet. Wi-Fi 6 is high-speed, with some routers offering up to AX11000 speeds and many devices supporting link speeds of 2.4Gbps. For pretty much anything you need to do on your wireless devices, this is more than fast enough. Wi-Fi 6E, however, doesn't set out to increase the top speed of Wi-Fi 6 but to keep those speeds up even in heavily congested areas.

While this is how it's viewed now, many don't realize that Pride was sparked as a form of resistance. In 1969, a community of LGTBQ peopled rioted against the New York Police Department following an unjust raid of Stonewall in Greenwich Village.

That's because the co-founder and general partner of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz loves blocking journalists, along with critics of the tech industry and anyone else who might be seen as an antagonist.

The punishment handed out Friday fell short of the 30 years that prosecutors had requested. With good behavior, Chauvin, 45, could be paroled after serving two-thirds of his sentence, or about 15 years. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE.

> At first glance, the forays Apple Inc., Google and other technology giants are making into the world of cars don't appear to be particularly lucrative.Building automobiles requires factories, equipment and an army of people to design and assemble large hunks of steel, plastic and glass. That all but guarantees slimmer profits. The world's top 10 carmakers had an operating margin of just 5.2% in 2020, a fraction of the 34% enjoyed by the tech industry's leaders, data compiled by Bloomberg show.But for Apple and other behemoths that are diving into self-driving tech or have grand plans for their own cars, that push isn't just about breaking into a new market — it's about defending valuable turf.

But if we use Python for the whole ecosystem, we can leverage the option of making things much more simpler.So I came up with a concept of using the messaging pattern for inter-service communication and call RPC to reduce the overhead of HTTP. I used Zeromq under the hood and made this framework to easily communicate with other services.

Professional cameras allow you to change your ISO or your sensitivity rating which means you can shoot in low light situations without losing the quality of the image.

It allows them to find food, avoid danger, and attract mates; it dominates their perceptions and guides their behavior; it dictates how they interpret and respond to the deluge of sensory information all around them. 'How we as biological creatures interface with chemistry in the world is profoundly important for understanding who we are and how we navigate the universe,' said Bob Datta, a neurobiologist at Harvard Medical School.

[Andreessen on Crypto](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/06/andreessen-on-crypto.html)


> From Noahpinion's interview with Marc Andreessen: [C]rypto represents an architectural shift in how technology works and therefore how the world works. That architectural shift is called distributed consensus — the ability for many untrusted participants in a network to establish consistency and trust. This is something the Internet has never had, but now it does, and I think it will take 30 years to work through all of the things we can do as a result. Money is the easiest application of this idea, but think more broadly — we can now, in theory, build Internet native contracts, loans, insurance, title to real world assets, unique digital goods (known as non-fungible tokens or NFTs), online corporate structures (such as digital autonomous organizations or DAOs), and on and on.

> Source: Sonny Dickson It's been a hectic week with Prime Day madness, but now that it's behind us, we can return to our regularly scheduled programming. It's good to be back! So let's start off with a classic question: what's in a name? Apparently, a recent survey by SellCell claims that 74% of people don't want the next iPhone to be called "iPhone 13," because of superstitions of bad luck and all that bad mojo. Honestly, I think it's a little silly not to want the next iPhone just because of the bad rap of the number "13" — did all of these people also skip out on using iOS 13? But I could totally see Apple skipping the number 13; I mean, they did that with nine, after all.

> Nikon is going all-in on the retro aesthetic with its latest Z-series mirrorless camera. The company says the new Z FC, officially styled 'Z fc,' is designed specifically to evoke its FM2 film SLR from the ‘80s, with dedicated dials for settings like shutter speed, exposure compensation, and ISO. The approach is similar to the Nikon DF, a retro-style full-frame DSLR that Nikon released in 2013. But the DF was much larger than the film cameras it was inspired by. The Z FC has a 20.9-megapixel APS-C sensor (and of course no SLR mirror and prism), which means the resulting camera is far more compact and looks a lot closer to something like an FM2.

> When Apple killed off the iMac Pro, we thought that was the end of the road for the high-end all-in-one computer. Yet when the iMac was completely revamped earlier this year, Apple only revealed the smaller 24-inch version. That left a very obvious question hanging in the air: What about the pro-level iMac to replace the current 27-inch iMac? It could be that Apple decides to leave the iMac Pro dead and buried and instead just offer a more powerful all-in-one under the regular iMac branding. But considering Apple's other product lines, it makes sense to offer an iMac Pro that offers a greater level of performance than the 24-inch iMac.

As soon as a card is inserted, things like screenshots are immediately saved to the new storage instead of the internal system memory. That means those of us who don't want to post screenshots immediately to Facebook or Twitter can quickly grab screenshots and other files from the Switch and move them elsewhere by removing the card. If you're going to quickly swap microSD cards back and forth on the Switch, it's important to know there's both a right and wrong way to do it.

> Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge AT&T and Google have announced that all Android phones on the network will use Google's Android Messages app for SMS and RCS services. T-Mobile made the exact same partnership deal with Google in March, which leaves Verizon as the only US carrier who hasn't committed to switching its customers to Android Messages by default. Along with the switch to Messages comes another important shift: real interoperability with RCS on other networks. AT&T has supported RCS for awhile now, but that support has been as haphazard as it was half-hearted.

Earlier this month, for example, it showed off concepts around a potential 'unmention' feature that would let users untag themselves from others' tweets. Today, the company is showing off a few more of its design explorations that would allow users to better control who can see their tweets and who ends up in their replies. The new concepts include a way to tweet only to a group of trusted friends, new prompts that would ask people to reconsider the language they're using when posting a reply, and a 'personas' feature that would allow you to tweet based on your different contexts — like tweets about your work life, your hobbies and interests, and so on.

The bill committed a grievous, very Republican sin: it promised the world to grassroots conservatives, and in the end delivered nothing. The bill's provisions sounded promising: daily fines on tech companies that banned political candidates, tough transparency requirements, and a right to sue for Florida citizens affected by censorship. But because the bill failed to categorize tech companies as common carriers or places of public accommodation, both of which are tightly restricted in who they can deny service to, it was a simple matter for tech companies to argue that the bill violated their First Amendment rights.

> At its height, animated sitcom King of the Hill was one of Fox's most popular shows in the US. In the UK, where I'm watching it, there's almost no audience at all for the series, as far as I know. When Disney Plus launched its adult-oriented Star channel in the US, pretty much every major Fox series landed on the service – Family Guy, American Dad, Bob's Burgers and Futurama. King of the Hill is sadly absent, leaving some strangely pricey DVDs as my only legal route to watch it. I can see why it doesn't have much of a footprint here.

[Twitter's Trusted Friends: How Sharing With Select People Might Work](https://screenrant.com/twitter-trusted-friends-facets-reply-preferences-concepts/)


> Twitter recently shared three concepts of how tweeting could change in the future — including Trusted Friends, Facets, and Reply Preferences. Twitter has shared a few new features it's considering for future versions of the app, including a ‘Trusted Friends' system that would allow users to only share tweets with a small group of other users they've specifically chosen. This (and two other features) are currently just concepts from Twitter and not actively in development, but even so, they provide insight into where Twitter envisions the social platform heading as the months and years go on.

Production issues that GPU manufacturers have been experiencing since 2020 are still happening, and US retailers – even major ones like Amazon and Best Buy – are still having a hard time restocking it. Even when stock for the Radeon RX 6800 does turn up, it's snatched up right away because of high demand.UK customers, however, have some options – although they are much more than this high-end graphics card's list or suggested retail price.

When you create intricate projects with your Cricut Maker, Cricut Explore, or Cricut Joy crafting/cutting machine, you'll need to "weed" it (remove the unwanted bits around the design.) This can be time-consuming and tricky if you don't have enough light.

> (Image credit: SonyLiv) Among the many frontline OTT platforms in India, SonyLiv receives a lot of flak over its clunky and unfriendly-to-use app. On most social media platforms, it is not uncommon to find SonyLiv users venting out their frustration over the app's alleged malfunctions. The fact that SonyLiv has access to popular live cricket feeds and sports action (Euro 2020 is on it, and the Tokyo Olympics will be streamed by it) makes it difficult to ignore it too. Last year's best web series, Scam 1992, was also its baby.

For now, the only place you can buy the ASUS ZenFone 8 for retail is ASUS's own online store. ASUS doesn't have a huge presence in the US smartphone market. So, it's no surprise that the new ZenFone 8 doesn't have as prominent of placement in major retailers or mobile carrier stores as the latest iPhones or Android phones.

However, the company said that this was a unique case, and players shouldn't expect cross-play in all Nintendo titles in the future.

The company debuted its Galaxy Z Flip lineup to tackle the vertical folding niche, and with the Galaxy Z Fold 2, Samsung gave us one of the very best foldables we've seen yet. As such, there's a lot of excitement and anticipation around the inevitable Galaxy Z Fold 3. The year-over-year improvements between the original Galaxy Fold and the Z Fold 2 are still kind of mind-blowing to this very day, so the idea of Samsung continuing to refine that formula is something we can't wait to see.

> Source: Benks A Chinese accessory maker has shared images of dummy models that it says represent design changes we can expect in Apple's upcoming iPhone 13. Benks took to Weibo sharing images it says represent the 'iPhone 13'. The units have a fairly strange brushed metal finish, and the pictures feature obviously blurred out Apple logos. As noted, these units are allegedly dummy iPhone 13 models the company has used to create cases for the upcoming device. There's no way to establish how Benks came upon these designs, however, they do appear to match previous rumors and leaks we've seen pertaining to the expected design of Apple's next flagship iPhone.

They were only discovered after an X-ray operator spotted them when scanning three consignments at a Delhi airport. The 90 iPhones were reportedly worth Rs.1 cr, or around $134,000. Marking the iPhones as garments would have allowed their importation without the need to pay the required fees — or that was the idea.

But in the early builds of Windows 11, retrieving the old Windows 10 Start Menu was always just a few clicks in Settings away. According to the changes made in the latest version of Windows 11, however, that's no longer the case. The shift happened in the second build of the Windows 11 beta software, which is now available through the Windows Insider program. Among other notable changes to the Start Menu, Microsoft has apparently removed the option from Settings entirely, leaving you with the bright and shiny new Start Menu whether you like it or not.

Loads of features, powerful servers, or maybe great support, low prices, or maybe some combination of these and other functionality important to the individual.Some specialist web hosting review websites also place a high weight on their own web hosting benchmarks, though, especially speed and host uptime (the proportion of time a website is available online).

> Jupiter is a stunning planet in many ways, with its beautiful bands of clouds, the largest storm in the solar system, and unusual phenomena like geometric storms at its poles. And it has some further oddities we're still learning about, such as the fact it has strange X-rays auroras somewhat comparable to the northern lights here on Earth. For 40 years, scientists have wondered how these X-ray auroras work, and now a new study reveals the mechanism behind them. Like the auroras on Earth, Jupiter's auroras are caused by electrically charged particles interacting with the planet's atmosphere.

> 07/10/2021 - 22:02 | By: Don Parsons The Ukrainian government has announced that they shut the largest cryptocurrency farm in the country and seized its assets, including 3800 PlayStation 4s (pictured above, credit SBU). This was a piece of almost 5000 parts of computer equipment seized. PlayStation 4 cryptocurrency mining? The government announcement (which we're using machine translation for) doesn't directly say what the PlayStation 4s were used for, but it is difficult to imagine anyone hooking up this many unless they were being used for cryptocurrency mining in this building.

Beyond DJI's political difficulties in the US, there are the added factors of increased competition from the likes of Autel and Skydio, plus recent changes to DJI's own range in the form of new models.

One of the rumors this week for the iPhone 13 is that it could be getting reverse wireless charging, you know, that thing that has been rumored since the iPhone 11? Source: UnclePan潘叔 According to this rumor, Max Weinbach and EverythingApplePro suggest that the next iPhone could have better heat dissipation and faster wireless charging.

> WTA's Hike Recommender. (WTA Photo) Seattle-area hikers know that on weekend mornings, popular trails such as Mt. Si are bound to be packed. The Washington Trail Association saw the need to add something new to prevent overcrowding and point hikers to different trails. WTA recently launched a new recommender in the 'My Backpack' feature on its website which recommends trails to users based on their preferences — including inclination, distance, location and more. WTA gives trail recommendations to hikers all the time, said Loren Drummond, WTA digital content manager, and the new feature digitizes that process.

The Amazon founder will make a similar journey on 20 July, on board one of his own Blue Origin spacecraft.Blue Origin has argued that Mr Branson's trip does not really count as a trip to space, since he did not cross the Kármán line that generally defined the boundary of space.

Although every iPhone from the iPhone 6s and newer is eligible for iOS 15, some of iOS 15's best features are only available on newer iPhone models. Whenever Apple releases a new iOS update, the company receives a heap of praise for supporting older iPhone models that are multiple years old.

As a successful businessman with a wife and kids, he had achieved what most people would call success, but for some reason his anxiety levels and social awkwardness seemed to be getting worse by the year. Having exhausted conventional treatment routes, Jacob started investigating alternative approaches—including the use of psychedelics. Jacob had never tried psychedelics before in his life. He considered himself a logical rationalist with a self-described 'zero tolerance for woo-woo,' so when his search for social anxiety treatment lead him to a psychospiritual retreat center in Mexico, referred to him by Psychedelic Times, he felt completely out of his element.

And the last one, the fifth-generation iPad mini, came out in March 2019. It's time for a thorough redesign, and according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in his latest newsletter, it's happening this fall. According to Gurman, the new iPad mini "should be a go" to launch this fall. It'll be the "biggest redesign" in the device's history, though that doesn't tell us much since the redesigns so far have been absolutely tiny.

But it's the similarities to how Chrome OS operates that have me intrigued the most. The reason for this is because, until earlier this year, Microsoft was working on a version of its operating system called Windows 10X. Some pundits have claimed that Windows 11 should be called Windows 11 Big Sur, a hat-tip to Apple's current version of macOS. But in reality, Windows 11 feels like a melting pot of features from macOS, Chrome OS, along with some Windows 10 zest on top.

> Despite a significant amount of hype leading up to this weekend's spaceflight launch, shares of Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE) have failed at important resistance after the company filed or a $500 million shelf offering of common stock. Now a new downtrend seems to be forming. Resistance is a large group of sellers who are all trying to sell their shares around the same price. In this case, it's $57.50. At resistance levels, there is more supply than demand. That's why rallies end and sometimes reverse when they reach them.

> Source: Apple Today saw Apple announce the MagSafe Battery Pack for iPhone 12 and we were all very excited about it. We'd been told by Bloomberg a while ago that this was coming, and here it is. But it leaves a sour taste in the mouth, and it isn't just that $99 asking price. As much as that $99 price does sting a little, anyone who follows Apple with any kind of regularity would surely know that anything south of $99 was never going to happen. I wouldn't have been surprised if it was more around the $119, point, so we should probably all be thankful for small mercies.

> France fined Google 500 million euros — $593 million — on Tuesday for failing to negotiate a deal 'in good faith' with news publishers on its platform. French authorities say Google ignored a 2020 order from regulators to negotiate a licensing deal with publishers to use short blurbs from articles in search results, according to a report by the New York Times. The case represents one of the first attempts to apply the European Union's new copyright directive intended to force internet platforms like Google and Facebook to compensate news organizations for their content, the report added.
