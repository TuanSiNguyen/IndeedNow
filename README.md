> While there are plenty of espresso makers out in the market, it's rare that you see a machine dedicated to making Turkish coffee. If you're a fan of this thick, strong brew, then the Beko Telvo Duo Turkish Coffee Machine is definitely something to have in your kitchen.What's impressive about it is that it makes enough Turkish coffee to serve six people, and while that might be great for larger gatherings, it's a bit of overkill if you just occasionally want a single cup. This also means that the machine is larger than most single-brew machines, so you'll need to have enough counter space to keep it handy.

During the Apple event, we got a new entry-level iPad, iPad mini 6, Apple Watch Series 7, and iPhone 13. While the Series 7 and iPhone 13 were definitely expected, I believe most of us were shocked that Apple decided to start off with the new iPad lineup.

> I wasn't sure what to expect from Kena: Bridge of Spirits. Developer Ember Lab's adorable adventure caused quite a stir when it was revealed at the PlayStation Future of Gaming showcase in 2020 Following a delay, it felt like Kena retreated into the shadows a bit - leaving some anxiety about whether it would still meet its new release date of September 21, and whether it would fall at the final hurdle many highly-anticipated releases have in the last couple of years.Developing a game in the current climate is a heavy cross to bear, particularly for a smaller studio like Ember.

> Source: Android Central I previewed Kena: Bridge of Spirits shortly before E3 2021. At the time, I only had an hour or so with the game, but felt confident that it was shaping up to be something special. After spending some more time with the final build, I'm happy that my initial impressions appear to be right. I haven't wanted to put the controller down since I started. Kena's characters and world hold such a charm that it's hard not to love them, and the gameplay continues to evolve throughout so that progression feels natural and earned.

Many models simply bump around, chaotically criss-crossing your floors until their battery runs low. This can result in clean floors, but you may find random spots that the vacuum completely missed, and these more basic robot vacuums may not always find their way back to their charging base to be ready for the next job (which could be needed right away if it missed a lot of spots).

> The Far Cry series has been no stranger to controversy. From criticism over Far Cry 4's cover art to the petition over Far Cry 5's portrayal of religious fanatics as villains, Ubisoft's long-running series is often contentious, to say the least, and Far Cry 6 is no different.Set on the fictional island of Yara, Far Cry 6 sees players taking on the role of Dani Rojas, who joins a guerrilla revolution against Yara's tyrannical dictator, Anton Castillo (played by Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito). It's a dark premise, but one that Ubisoft plans to balance with the chaotic, playground mechanics that the Far Cry series is known for – a balancing act that has already garnered criticism from some.

Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey recently analyzed seeds stuck in the footprints to determine their approximate age, ranging from around 22,800 and 21,130 years ago.The findings may shed light on a mystery that has long intrigued scientists: When did people first arrive in the Americas, after dispersing from Africa and Asia?Most scientists believe ancient migration came by way of a now-submerged land bridge that connected Asia to Alaska.

> It's time to take the first look at the recently introduced iPhone 13 series. The phones go on sale in India from today although we hear and see that the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max may hit the market only in limited quantity.

The price starts from Rs 69,990 and goes up to Rs 1,79,990.

He was citing David Leonhardt's New York Times newsletter. Biden and Leonhardt frame the statistic as encouraging: only 1 in 5,000. But it isn't good news or bad news. It's essentially meaningless. What's more important is knowing that when community spread of the coronavirus is high, the risk of breakthrough infection needs to be taken seriously, which means combining vaccination with other public health measures.

James Bond.'It's nearly six decades since Sean Connery first uttered those immortal words in Dr No, and 24 (official) movies and six actors later, the Bond series remains one of the most popular franchises in movie history.But with all those missions to choose from, working out how to watch the James Bond movies in order isn't quite as simple as it might seem. Sure, you could view them in release date order, but what if you prefer the quippy charm of Roger Moore to Sean Connery's more rugged portrayal of a government assassin? What if Daniel Craig, the current incumbent of the famous role, is your definitive 007? And what if you'd rather skip the more disappointing entries in the franchise entirely – A View to a Kill and Die Another Day, we have you in our sights…With the long-delayed 26th entry in the 007 series, No Time To Die, arriving in theaters on September 30 (UK)/October 8 (US), we've taken a tour through nearly 60 years of glamorous locales, femmes fatales and vodka martinis (shaken, not stirred, naturally) to explain how to watch the James Bond movies in order.

However, before you hand it over to someone else or drop it off at FedEx, there's still some work you'll need to do.

[Why are so few people actually using 5G in the U.S.? Here's what the experts say](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/5g-rollout-lagging-united-states/)


> Despite many devices boasting 5G capabilities these days, a recent study showed people in the U.S. spend less than 25% of their online time connected to a 5G network. This may be because 5G-enabled devices are outpacing 5G access. Last year, 14 million users subscribed to mobile 5G services, and the number was forecasted to grow to 554 million by the end of this year. Today, more than halfway into 2021, T-Mobile has already connected 305 million people with 5G networks. Along with T-Mobile, other major mobile operators like Verizon and AT&T were quick to roll out 5G in the last few months, collectively covering 75% of the U.

> So I am currently sharing my first video shot with cinematic video and thought I would share some thoughts and maybe spur some conversation. This was the absolute one feature I was looking forward to, and that with the "97%" more light back wide camera were enough to upgrade from my 12PM that I only got last December 26th. Just a few thoughts though. 1. Getting video off the phone is going to be a chore. In order to actually keep the depth effect, apple says you need to Airdrop or use the photos app, you cannot use iMazing or third party apps, the video just comes out as 1080p video with no depth effects.

At some point during the three-day spaceflight, an alarm alerted the four Crew Dragon passengers to an issue with — of all things — the toilet. A faulty space toilet may sound rather trivial when you consider other things that you really wouldn't want to go wrong while orbiting 357 miles (575 kilometers) above Earth. But the issue could've resulted in waste products floating around the spacecraft in the microgravity conditions, causing serious problems for those on board.

It follows a damning report by Facebook that revealed that Instagram was causing harm to the body image of young girls. According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal, internal documents from Facebook show the company was aware that it was having a detrimental affect on the mental health of teen girls.

> Source: Joe Maring / iMore Instagram owner Facebook has today announced plans to pause its planned Instagram Kids launch, allowing it time to build new parental supervision tools. In a press release penned by Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, Facebook says that it believes it's best to give kids access to a special version of Instagram, rather than them use the normal version. We firmly believe that it's better for parents to have the option to give their children access to a version of Instagram that is designed for them — where parents can supervise and control their experience — than relying on an app's ability to verify the age of kids who are too young to have an ID.

I have spent some time with all four models -- iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max -- but this review focuses on the standard iPhone 13 model.

Several users and Apple's partners, such as Verizon Communications Inc and Best Buy, have highlighted delays after pre-ordering began in September due to a shortage of supply and high demand, with analysts warning of one of the longest waiting times for the phone in recent years.

If the measure makes it to the November 2022 ballot and passes, drivers could end up earning as little as a quarter of the minimum wage, according to a University of California-Berkeley study published on Wednesday. The UC Berkeley Labor Center researchers, Ken Jacobs and Michael Reich, identified multiple loopholes that would change the guaranteed pay from $18 per hour to $4.

> If you're pondering the question of what makes for the best all-round gaming monitor, the new Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165 might just be the answer. On paper, at least.With a 32-inch 1440p panel running at up to 165Hz refresh, it arguably nails exactly the right balance between performance and graphical detail. Sure, there are gaming monitors with more pixels than the Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165. Others hum along at even higher refresh rates or offer more overall inches. But you quickly run into one obvious issue with ever-higher spec screens.

[Best 15-inch laptop 2021: top picks with 15-inch displays](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-15-inch-laptop)


> The best 15-inch laptops hit the sweet spot for most people between portability and practicality, making them ideal for business, school, or creative work on the go. They are often just as powerful as the best 17-inch laptop, while being able to fit into just about any backpack or tote bag when you're in a hurry as any of the best 13-inch laptops on the market right now.What's more, the best 15-inch laptops for gaming are also the smallest you can realistically get if you want to seriously game on the go, while productive users will find that anything less than 15 inches doesn't have the screen real estate to handle a moderately sized spreadsheet (and you can forget about that tenkey numpad on a 13-inch!).

The bladeless Haxson AirFan includes a heating mode, a formaldehyde sensor, and a purifier while maintaining a rather svelte profile. The HEPA filter should be able to stop contaminants like dust, smoke, pollen, and odor. On the audio side, the AirFan uses Bluetooth 5.0, and plays nice with both Alexa and Google Assistant. This allows you to ask the AirFan to dim its light, set an alarm, or answer inane trivia that's keeping you up in the middle of the night.

We'll show you how to opt in, set a predefined status, and set your custom status. How to turn on Chat in Gmail Right off the bat, if you don't have a chat tab at the bottom of Gmail, you do not have chat turned on yet, and you will not be able to set your status.

Several companies, including SpaceX and Amazon, have been working on similar tech, but have so far only been able to create connections by routing the satellite's signals through a physical terminal on Earth first.

The eruption is not in an area with homes and is entirely contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Officials said increased earthquake activity and ground swelling before the eruption put them on high alert. Fissures then opened in the summit area and sent lava fountaining into the sky. Now the area has filled with molten rock, creating a lake of lava in the volcano's crater. The new lava is an expected evolution of a volcano that is recharging after a huge eruption in 2018 drained much of its magma.

As for higher refresh rates, 144Hz and above, there seems to be very little demand for those (144/165Hz is typical of gaming hardware, both PC and smartphone).

However, as is common with high-profile iOS releases, iPhone users have been experiencing a highly annoying battery depletion problem following the introduction of iOS 15. According to a Tom's Guide article, the famous music streaming service Spotify could be to blame.

> E10 fuel economy: Drivers are being warned to save money by regulating their revs. Some drivers have expressed dissatisfaction with the new E10 gasoline's efficiency and fuel economy when compared to E5 gasoline. E10 gasoline has divided drivers since its launch in early September, with some hailing the environmental benefits and others noting that their car isn't as efficient. Using E10 gasoline reduces fuel economy by about 1%, however this is unlikely to be evident in ordinary driving. Other factors, such as driving style or driving with under-inflated tyres, have a far greater impact on fuel economy than the use of E10 gasoline.

> Ten years after Apple founder Steve Jobs' death, the company is a profit machine but some say it has lost its creative magic By Julie JAMMOT Ten years after Apple founder Steve Jobs' death, the firm has grown into a colossus of devices and services that is the world's most valuable company, but the tech legend's diehard fans lament its lost aura of revolution.

> It's starting to sound like the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro could be the most intriguing Pixel phones in a long time, with the company seemingly rebounding from its 2020 slump year that saw the less-than-interesting Pixel 4a, 4a 5G and 5.Even the recent Pixel 5a was a familiar-feeling phone, but by what rumors suggest - and what Google itself has said - the Pixel 6 range represents a big step up for the company.Google has officially revealed these handsets, and they look just like the leaks predicted: sleek devices with a visor-like camera block that splits the back cover in two.

The energy crisis that has engulfed most of Europe has generated tensions among EU member states.

Some member states have blamed Russia for limiting gas supplies on purpose, while others have blamed Brussels' ambitions for a green economic reform for the issue.

> If a company is hit with a major cyberattack, it may not be the only one that suffers. An organization's customers may also be vulnerable, and these attacks are hard to defend against. They are called supply chain attacks, in which, by attacking one major supplier, the hackers can reach its customers through striking less secure elements in a supply chain. One example is the cyberattack against the Israeli company Voicenter last month, which was hit by a group of foreign hackers. The cloud-based call center service provider counts companies like MobileEye, eToro, Check Point and Similar Web among its clients.

If you wait until Black Friday, the items that you purchase may not arrive on time, and they may even go on backorder if the product that you bought is a popular one.

[Best Squid Game memes: The show is serious, but these jokes are funny](https://www.cnet.com/news/best-squid-game-memes-the-show-is-serious-but-these-jokes-are-funny/)


> No doubt about it, the plot of the new Netflix drama, Squid Game, is nothing to laugh at. In the show, which might end up as the streaming service's biggest hit ever, financially strapped people compete in a tournament of kids' games where losers get killed. Not very funny. But the show has captured the public's imagination and as always, the memes and jokes have followed.  It's easy to see why -- Squid Game has many complex characters, as well as plenty of visually striking scenes and objects (the Dalgona cookies, the game organization's business card, the outfits).

However, there is no external source of revenue for those payoffs. Instead, the payoffs come entirely from new investment money, while the operators take away a large portion of this money. Investing in bitcoin (or any crypto with similar protocol) checks all these items. The investors are all those who have bought or will buy bitcoins; they invest by buying bitcoins, and cash out by selling them.

Generally speaking, the best iPhone game controller usually gives you better, well, control and can make playing for long stretches easier on mobile. That's why it's so upsetting that the game currently does not offer controller support. Can you use a controller in Pokémon Unite on iPhone and iPad? As ridiculous as it sounds, Pokémon Unite on mobile did not launch with controller support for either the iOS or Android versions.

But considering both tablets are about a year old with aging chipsets, we're eagerly anticipating when the new Galaxy Tab S8 will arrive. The last few Galaxy Tab S tablets were announced and launched in late summer, but Samsung is taking its time with the S8 series. This could be due to recent chip shortages, or because Samsung allegedly plans to release three new tablets this round, including a Tab S8 "Ultra" version that could go toe-to-toe with the iPad Pro in size and performance.

Physical games can be passed back and forth, but digital games technically stay connected to the Nintendo account and Switch console they were purchased on. If you buy a digital game on one Switch, it makes sense that you might want to share it on, say, your child's Switch for them to play. But is Gameshare possible? Technically, there is no official game-sharing service on Nintendo's systems.

Visa's neural network assesses more than 500 risk attributes in about a millisecond to predict every transaction's fraud probability. Data released by AusPayNet suggests it is working, as overall card fraud only rose 0.6% in 2020, even though online retail spending grew 44%. Enumeration attacks – an automated, brute force approach that guesses and tests payment credentials such as account numbers, CVV2, and/or expiry dates during online checkout – came to the fore locally and internationally during the past year.

A handful of other devices like the HP Elite Dragonfly Max business laptop also have 5-megapixel cameras but (a) they're likely to be 2-in-1 convertible laptops and (b) they still account for a tiny fraction of the market.So why is it that, in this day and age where hybrid working is all the rage, where Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Google Meet are household names and even mainstream smartphones (like the Infinix Zero 8) boast a selfie camera with 48-megapixel resolution, do laptop owners have to put up with VGA webcams (yes VGA)?VGA, for those below a certain age, refers to an antiquated, obsolete, bygone resolution of 640 by 480 pixels (or 307,000 pixels in all).

> TODAY'S BEST DEALSRemember when Sony cameras didn't even offer vloggers so much as an articulating screen? That wasn't long ago, but the Sony ZV-E10 is the latest in a growing line of video-centric Sony cameras that fixes this limitation, while neatly filling a gap between its entry-level (Sony ZV-1) and mid-range (Sony A6100) offerings.Like an A6100 spin-off with a video-tastic bod, the ZV-E10 is effectively two parts old internals and one-part new body, with a dash of souped-up software. What's even better is that this new entry wants to scratch your video itch without going over $1,000/ £1,000/ AUS $1,500 mark.

[Mystery of a strange mirrored double galaxy solved using Hubble data](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/hubble-mirrored-galaxy/)


> When telescopes like Hubble peer out into the cosmos, they can sometimes sneak a view of very distant objects using a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. This is where a massive object like a galaxy passes between a distant object and Earth, and the gravity of this intermediate object warps spacetime and acts as a magnifying glass. This allows astronomers to glimpse objects which would otherwise be too faint and far away to be visible. But sometimes these phenomena result in strange outcomes, like an oddity spotted by Hubble in 2013 which appeared to be two objects that were perfect mirror images of each other.

> A simple cooling system driven by the capture of passive solar energy could provide low-cost food refrigeration and living space cooling for impoverished communities with no access to the electricity grid. The system, which has no electrical components, exploits the powerful cooling effect that occurs when certain salts are dissolved in water. After each cooling cycle, the system uses solar energy to evaporate the water and regenerate the salt, ready for reuse. 'Hot regions have high levels of solar energy, so it would be very attractive to use that solar energy for cooling,' says Wenbin Wang, a postdoc in Peng Wang's lab.

Specifically, they would be adapting the terrors of the Spencer Mansion from Resident Evil 1. This raised several questions for me. Zombie games are plentiful. Horror board games investigating a mansion are abundant as well. So what exactly can Steamforged Games bring to a project that, adaptation of source material aside, do to help spice up such well-trodden formula and tropes?

> It's difficult for startups on a small budget to attract executives with the knowledge base to propel them forward, but Continuum, a talent marketplace for fractional employees, doesn't think it should be. The remote-first company, which launched today, has been quietly developing a tool that matches venture-backed companies with executives who have been-there-done-that, but don't want to be tied down again by a full-time position. Continuum was founded in 2020 by Nolan Church, former Carta chief people officer and DoorDash head of talent; Greg White, former Carta head of DevOps and security engineering; and Mary Nelson, former Voxer head of product and design.

> Lone Echo 2 will be the last major VR game released for the now discontinued Rift platform. With the Oculus Rift S having now been sunset, and the Facebook-owned company moving away from PC-only experiences entirely, we don't imagine another worthwhile title will wind up as an exclusive to the Oculus Rift store.It is perhaps ironic then that we chose to review this game using the Rift's successor, the Oculus Quest 2, connecting our headset to our PC through the wireless Air Link feature.No matter what Oculus device you choose though, this is a truly great VR game from developer Ready at Dawn - a team that definitely understands what the platform is capable of.

[Apple Watch 7's bigger screen: just how does it compare to older Apple Watches?](https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-watch-7s-bigger-screen-just-how-does-it-compare-to-older-apple-watches)


> (Image credit: TechRadar) One of the headline upgrades on the Apple Watch 7 is its larger screen, which is roughly 20% bigger than on the Apple Watch 6. That's achieved through a slightly larger body (41mm or 45mm compared to 40mm or 44mm) coupled with much smaller bezels of just 1.7mm.So although the Apple Watch 7 is larger on your wrist than the equivalent Apple Watch 6, we found in our Apple Watch 7 review that the difference is negligible, while the screen itself is quite a lot bigger here.

The iPhone 13 Mini, on the other hand, is a really petite smartphone, that is extremely powerful.

Yep, that's right, the classic FPS game is now playable on Twitter (provided youâ€™re good at coding and love trial and error).This isnâ€™t the first weird place weâ€™ve seen the game series crop up.

Still, you might be surprised to find out that it has never had its own branded wearable. We hear rumblings each year that Google is releasing a Pixel Watch, but it still hasn't. Revamps of its phone OS with Android 12 and the wearable platform with Wear OS 3, however, now means 2021 is the perfect time for Google to release a Pixel Watch. Samsung currently has a monopoly on the latest iteration of Wear OS with its recently launched Galaxy Watch 4 series and as great as Samsung is at many things, this smartwatch isn't shaping up to be the Wear OS savior many fans hoped for.

> Esperion Therapeutics Inc's (NASDAQ: ESPR) cholesterol drug marketing strategy has soured badly, as it has been struggling to sell its heart disease pill for more than a year. What Happened: The Company says it will cut about 40% of its staff over the next few weeks, or approximately 170 staffers are on the chopping block. The reductions are expected to save up to $80 million going into 2022. Esperion thought that with a cheaper pricing strategy, it could beat out the expensive PCSK9s Amgen Inc's (NASDAQ: AMGN) Repatha and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: REGN) Praluent.

> We had known that Apple was working on an all-new MacBook Pro based on Apple Silicon for quite a long time. I hadn't been particularly interested in the rumored machine because of the tremendously good M1 Macs that the company has been spinning out for about a year now. The new iMac is an incredible machine that's matched by a gorgeous design. Even the first M1 machines introduced last November are still very good and very fast computers. So I had no intention of buying a MacBook Pro today. Now if you know me, you're probably thinking 'this was inevitable' or 'of course he was going to buy one.

That made WhatsApp more akin to popular video chat apps like Zoom and Google Meet. Now you can join these group video calls directly from the chat tab.

> The Sony A7 IV is one of the most hotly-anticipated cameras of the past few years – and now the full-frame camera has landed, it's pretty clear to see why. On paper, it's shaping up to be one of the best mirrorless cameras you can buy. (Want to jump straight to our first impressions? Head to our hands-on Sony A7 IV review).The A7 IV is the successor to the Sony A7 III, a camera that arrived in March 2018 and immediately changed our expectations for entry-level full-frame cameras. The bad news is that the A7 IV will be pricier than its predecessor, costing $2,599 / £2,400 / AU$$4,299 (body only) when it becomes available from December (or late November in Australia).

The pandemic has accelerated this trend and made it harder for already stretched mental health services to deal with demand. Mental health hospitalisations among children have increased substantially during the pandemic, while mental health distress levels have doubled for young workers. While this data is startling, a lack of data is one of the key issues in the gaps we have in mental healthcare, much more-so than other chronic and acute healthcare issues.

> An assistant director unwittingly handed Alec Baldwin a loaded weapon and told him it was safe to use in the moments before the Hollywood actor fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, according to court records released late on Friday. A search warrant filed in a Santa Fe court revealed Baldwin was informed by the assistant that he was holding a "cold gun" on the set of the film "Rust." However, the gun was actually loaded with live rounds, and when Baldwin pulled the trigger on the set of his latest movie, he killed Hutchins.

"Come and manufacture in India, you (Tesla) will get all the tax benefits you want," he said while replying to a question about the company's demand related to tax concessions.

> Written by Adam Satariano and Paul Mozur Russia's boldest moves to censor the internet began in the most mundane of ways — with a series of bureaucratic emails and forms. The messages, sent by Russia's powerful internet regulator, demanded technical details — like traffic numbers, equipment specifications and connection speeds — from companies that provide internet and telecommunications services across the country. Then the black boxes arrived. The telecom companies had no choice but to step aside as government-approved technicians installed the equipment alongside their own computer systems and servers.

> Since the new standard of unleaded petrol was launched in the UK in September, drivers have been noting issues with their cars. E10 was introduced to replace E5 and move the country towards the Government's climate goals. E10 is blended with up to 10 percent bioethanol and thus releases less emissions, believed to cut transport CO2 emissions by 750,000 tonnes per year. However, some drivers have reported that the fuel has caused them to experience issues with their engines, resulting in higher fees for the driver.

> You can use Microsoft Office apps for free.  Josh Miller/CNET Whether it's for work or personal use, you'll probably need to access a Microsoft Word document, a PowerPoint presentation or other basic tools found in Microsoft 365 at some point. The service, formerly known as Office 365, offers more features than the average office software, but it can be costly. If you don't want to spend your money on Microsoft 365, don't stress. There are a few ways to get the service for free.  Microsoft's suite of productivity software -- which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Microsoft Teams, OneDrive and SharePoint -- typically costs $150 for a one-time installation (as Office 365), or between $70 and $100 every year for subscription service access across devices and family members (as Microsoft 365).

[前端小哥玩HTML复选框上瘾：能画logo做视频还开源成JS库](http://www.cnbeta.com/articles/tech/1194289.htm)


> 万万没想到，如此普通的复选框，竟也能玩出这种高度！例如点一下复选框，屏幕就像被投入石子的水面泛出波纹： 设定好初始状态，就可以开始展示《生命游戏》的演化过程；控制上下左右，还能还原经典游戏《贪吃蛇》；这就是一位做前端开发的小哥Bryan，近期在自己的网站上发布的有关checkbox（复选框）的新玩法。这个项目在Hacker News上引来了大量网友评论。高赞评论已经给小朋友安排得明明白白了~而面对一些诸如'为什么要用复选框，普通像素就可以达到这种效果'的质疑，也有人为Bryan说话：回到这件事本身，其实在去年早些时候，他就建了一个名为Checkboxland的JavaScript库。它可以将任何内容呈现为HTML复选框。还有更厉害的玩法讲真，刚才展示的复选框效果，只能说是'开胃菜'。不仅仅是简单的动画，日常拍下的照片，记录的生活vlog，一样可以成为'复选框'的素材。小哥本人也一度以为灵感耗尽，但在参阅了一篇关于将图像转化为ASCII的文章之后，Bryan将耐克和苹果的logo转化了出来（不建议转化迪士尼的logo）。小哥本人也是老二次元了，《Bad Apple》也是信手拈来：随后，自嘲'the CheckBox guy'的小哥赋予了复选框更多的可能，他又拓展了Checkboxland API，用来加载任何视频并生成复选框版本。下面这个看起来就像进入了《星际穿越》的五维立方体。而此刻你如果打开摄像头，Bryan还可以带领你半只脚踏进《黑客帝国》~赶快学起来，说不定还能用来画心形图，成为你的表白神器（不是）！复选框花式玩法，什么原理？看似炫酷的效果实际制作过程只需分为两大步，手把手教你！1.

Rockstar Games' Definitive Edition will offer quality-of-life improvements to all three of GTA's PS2 entries, including better aiming and reworked visuals, while retaining the original essence of GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas.

> The iPhone 13 brings new features like better cameras and longer battery life, but it's missing some capabilities.  Apple's iPhone 13 and 13 Pro certainly have a lot to offer over their predecessors: longer battery life, better cameras and more base-level storage space. While we loved the new cameras -- especially Cinematic mode -- there are plenty of features we had hoped to see on the iPhone 13 lineup but are missing from Apple's latest devices. Many of these capabilities are available on Android competitors, while some can be found on other Apple products.

> Abhilash Panda PortraitBy Abhilash PandaAkhilesh is an average 19-year-old boy in a small town in Rajasthan, who like any other youngster, apart from studying, likes to meet his friends, play online games and share notes on Tiger Shroff's latest story or the Badshah hit that has caught the fancy of the nation. He and his friends share memes, watch back-to-back reels and have their own little party going. All this while using their smartphones paired with a set of earbuds.One trip to the outskirts of any metro city in India and you will notice a strange phenomenon—youngsters sitting at market squares—or how we know them as 'mandis' —excitedly comparing their days' experiences with their friends with almost all of them wearing some or the other wearable device.

While the feature may be useful for some, it can also be a hindrance at times. When the autocorrect option is enabled, it can make it extremely difficult to type, as it can completely alter the word that you are looking to note down. In such cases, disabling the feature is a good idea, as it gives us more control on what we are typing.

It feels solid but lightweight, old-fashioned but uniquely modern. It's a study in opposites. With active noise canceling and Bluetooth connectivity, these have become my everyday drivers. We plugged them in when playing a game and switched to Bluetooth mode when we were out and about. The sound quality is rich, layered, and textured.

The comment, made on a call with investors this afternoon, speaks to Facebooks' concerns about declining usage among teens and young adults. 'So much of our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them, rather than specifically for young adults,' Zuckerberg said. TikTok is 'one of the most effective competitors we've ever faced' He suggested the change will be more than just lip service.

Patel soon stumbled upon equivalency tables, where universities track which courses from other institutions can be counted for credit during a transfer process. While seemingly innocuous, the tables gave him key data of where Boston University draws a line around accepting credits from other institutions – and where it contradicts itself. He eventually appealed to BU, a school I also attended, and pointed out that the university accepted credit from universities that accepted FIT's coursework.

> Many midrange TVs like this 60Hz Samsung Q60T are marketed with higher "motion" numbers. Geoffrey Morrison/CNET Refresh rate is one of the more confusing aspects of TV technology and TV makers don't do much to explain it. In fact, they often obscure it. Refresh rate is a number that specifies how many times per second the image on your TV changes. With most TVs it's 60, though it's rare you'll ever see a TV with that number listed. Instead, manufacturers use different technologies, such as the soap opera effect and black frame insertion, to claim a higher number.

He wrote that rather than money as we know it, in the future "our assets will be 100% invested at all times". In this vision of the future of money, transactions will be settled through the transfer of baskets of assets between counterparties without the intermediary of money. In an always-online world, what is the point of paying fees to sell assets, buy currency and then transfer currency to someone who is going to sell it to buy other assets? In a time before networks, when strangers came to do business, they preferred to trust cold hard cash rather than each other.

It is available for access to anyone and everyone with access to the internet. There is a whole lot more to the web which is not accessible to everyone. People call it the dark web. Curious to know what the dark web is, who uses it, and why it is a maligned space? Let's take a look: What is the Dark Web?

> Story highlights Elon Musk has offered to sell stocks and give around $6 billion to WFP. But he has a condition that WFP will have to show how its accounting is done. David Beasley, WFP director, has invited Musk for a chat on the same topic. Elon Musk threw a challenge at the United Nations over the weekend. It was not about his companies or his current favourite - the Dogecoin, but about something as serious as global hunger. In a response to United Nations World Food Program (WFP) director David Beasley - who told CNN that a one-time payment of 2 per cent wealth of Musk or billionaires alike can solve global hunger - Musk, kind of, agreed to give his money but only if the UN comes up with the right strategy.

First, a brief bit of history. IELLO was founded in 2004 and was known for distribution and eventually localization for games aimed at the French market. In 2009, the company began publishing its own games and established it's own own US LLC based in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2012. The studio is probably the most well known for publishing the kaiju-themed mayhem of King of Tokyo as well as the covert cypher-cracking competitive experience, Decrypto.

Now we no longer have the 11 inchers and the 13 has upgraded to 14 and 15 to 16. Thanks to smaller bezels we don't really feel that the display upgrades hurt the body or weight dimensions of the devices. So hypothetically speaking would an 18" (that replaces the 17" devices) interest you? Here are the speculation filled specifications to help you decide better. I personally would buy it solely for the sweet display.

> (Image credit: FromSoftware) Despite rumors of a Bloodborne port coming to PC, it's unfortunately never been officially revealed. But, thanks to a dedicated and talented team of developers, we'll now have a PS1 demake style of the game.Bloodborne PSX is a 'demake' of the original PS4 title, reimagined in the graphical style of a PlayStation X game. It won't cover the entire game, but the devs will at least cover the Father Gascoigne fight and possibly even up to Vicar Amelia.This particular demake also isn't interested in recreating Bloodborne perfectly but will instead feature alterations to map design, mechanics, and dialogue.

So, something that was just Rs 40,000 a few years ago now costs almost twice that much. Moreover, most companies are selling their flagship devices with top-of-the-line features and best-in-class experience at that price point. So, why pay a premium for an iPhone.

> When braving the cold, wet outdoors in wintertime, you still need to do two things: Keep your hands warm and use your smartphone. For that, you will need a special pair of gloves that can do both jobs. You can't use a smartphone with just any gloves because your smartphone's capacitive touchscreen, blanketed with electrodes, is designed to react to taps, touches, and swipes on your screen with conductive material — like your fingertips. Touchscreen gloves bridge that gap with fabric that emulates your skin's conductive properties.

> Most fitness trackers keep a fair number of the same stats: things like steps taken, distance traveled, and, of course, calories burned. But how accurate is the calorie counter on a Fitbit?The quick answer: Definitely not 100 percent accurate. The slightly longer answer: It's not perfect, but no calorie counter is and Fitbit is likely as good as any. A 2017 study found the Fitbit Surge had a median error of 27 percent when counting calories burned. At face value, that seems like a lot of error. But it was actually one of the best-performing trackers among the devices tested at the time, which included the Apple Watch, Basis Peak, Fitbit Surge, Microsoft Band, Mio Alpha 2, PulseOn, and Samsung Gear S2.

> Nov 6, 2016 502 6,323 Earth I am using Mac Mail to access email on AOL Mail. I recently logged in to AOL Mail directly on the web and in a momentary lapse of judgment deleted the contents of the Sent folder. The next time I used Mac Mail, I found that the Sent folder there is empty as well. Not remembering everything that was in it, I would like to restore the contents from my Time Machine backup. So two questions: 1. There are websites that describe how to do this, some more confusing than others, so if someone has a really easy way please refer me to it.

Another trove of leaked Facebook internal research documents has revealed that the company was aware of the fact that over 350 million users had reported indulging in compulsive usage that bordered on the edge of addiction, but the company ended up disbanding the team behind the findings. In the past few weeks, multiple news organizations with access to leaked internal documents have published reports about some extremely worrying decision-making patterns at Facebook, which heavily sided with profitability over the well-being of users.

Pro workflows may require users to disable the adaptive ProMotion display and lock the frame rate. ProMotion on Apple devices dates back to 2017 with the second-generation iPad Pro models, and more recently, the iPhone 13 Pro. It allows for the display to go as low as 24fps and up to a buttery-smooth 120Hz. The tech is a great battery saver as it can change the frame rate on the fly based on what's being displayed on the screen.

Humans, and many of the other animals we've come to think of as unusually bright, such as chimpanzees and dolphins, all have large brains. And it's long been assumed that the smallest brains simply don't have the capacity to support complex mental processes. But what if they do?The vast majority of Earth's animal species are rather small, and a vanishingly small portion of them have been studied at all, much less by cognition researchers.

[Where Cards Fall Review](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/where-cards-fall)


> Memories of the past can be good, bad, or somewhere in between. A day at the arcade, a lonesome Christmas night, and a minimum wage shift at a fast food restaurant. Where Cards Fall walks us through the various stages of youth of a nameless character.  Although the game's name has ‘cards' in the title, it is far from a traditional card game. Instead, Where Cards Fall takes place over a number of puzzles. You goal is to form a path using cards to get to the gate at the end of the puzzle. Once you get to the gate, it unlocks a piece of the main character's past in the form of a cutscene.

It's safe to say the platform has established itself as one of the premier streaming platforms, thanks to its exclusive family-friendly offerings from Disney itself and Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, National Geographic, and 20th Century Studios. While the catalog size may not rival Netflix and the competition just yet, some awesome Disney+ originals are available, and there are plans for at least 10 Marvel and 10 Star Wars series to hit the platform over the next few years.

> While we wait to hear updates about the Hubble Space Telescope, which is currently in safe mode and not collecting science data while a problem is investigated, we can still enjoy the beautiful images captured by the telescope in the past. One such image, recently released by NASA, shows a striking blue planetary nebula located in the constellation of Eridanus. The image shows the planetary nebula NGC 1535, also known as Cleopatra's Eye. Somewhat confusingly, planetary nebulae have nothing to do with planets — they are in fact shells of hot gas which is given off by red giant stars in the late stages of their lives.

Express readers have blasted SADIQ KHAN's proposed auto tax revisions as 'utterly ludicrous' and a sort of 'daylight theft.' The initiative has now been extended from Central London to all highways in the North and South Circular, thanks to Sadiq Khan's new Ultra Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ) extension. Thousands of drivers will be charged an extra £12.50 to use the roads if their vehicles do not meet emissions regulations.

> I think I've reached the point where I have a good understanding of how decorators work in Python and how they can be extremely useful. The syntactic sugar (@) makes decorated functions more readable. And decorators really implement the concept of 'open for extension, closed for modification' quite nicely. However, I still can't get over why the concept of function closure is such a big deal in every intermediate/advanced Python book. As far as I can tell, every decorator (or decorator factory) could be implemented with a class instead of a function.

Interestingly, the first-ever image of a black hole captured in 2019 depicted the one at the heart of M87 and was observed using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

Perhaps more importantly, though, for the Biden agenda and the planet—and despite legitimate complaints from the bill's critics—this landmark event can also plausibly be described as green infrastructure week. On Friday night, the House of Representatives passed the mammoth hard infrastructure and climate bill known generally as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, or BIF, after a concession from progressives who'd wanted the bill passed alongside the more climate- and family-focused Build Back Better legislation.

Her core message was the same dire warning she's sounded on both sides of the Atlantic: Facebook prioritizes profit over safety, choosing to ignore the amplification of toxic content that's harmful to individuals, societies and democracy. And that regulatory oversight is thus essential to rein in and make such irresponsibly operated platform power accountable — with no time for lawmakers to lose in imposing rules on social media.

> Hi everyone, I need your input on a potential purchase decision. I am looking at a deal for a 2nd gen ipad pro that is 256 gb and 12.7 inch going for about $550-600 CAD. Now this 2nd gen ipad pro does come with a logitech combo case and keyboard, apple pencil. The seller purchased this back in Christmas of 2018. Currently I have a 6th gen Ipad 128 gb. I don't really have an issue with it at the moment but I do think I can benefit from a bigger screen of the Ipad pro. I have two years left of school and I still maintain my macbook air that I purchased back in 2016.

> Apple Inc failed to persuade a federal judge to push back a December 9 deadline to change the lucrative business model for its App Store while the iPhone maker's legal fight with Epic Games Inc is appealed. Unless the iPhone maker wins a reprieve from an appeals court, it will soon have to start allowing developers to steer customers to payment methods outside the App Store, an overhaul the judge ordered in September that could cost the tech giant a few billion dollars annually. Apple asked US District Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers to put on hold a part of the injunction that said the company must undo its rule forbidding developers from using web links or other means within apps to inform consumers about payment methods outside the App Store.

Leveraging technology to maximize the efficiencies of vendor inventory-managed programs. getty When new technology is introduced, it often sparks the question 'What will it replace?' There are certainly cases where a new technology does replace something, typically older technology or processes. However, it's just as likely that the technology has been designed not to replace people or processes but to improve local service and the customer experience. In an era of automated call centers and faceless e-commerce transactions, the notion of better service through technology may feel counterintuitive, but our world is filled with examples where technology, paired with local personnel, is elevating service levels and raising the bar for what we consider to be good customer service.

> CONNECTICUT, USA — Being a teenager usually means there's a lot to like about life. "I like to play lacrosse, hang out with my friends, and probably shop too," Mia Carrera, of Southington, said. Scrolling through social media is also at the top of that list. However, when it comes to that, there's also plenty to dislike. "It makes you feel like sad at times because you don't feel enough for other people. I don't know, people are like judgmental and stuff," said Macey Carrera, Mia's sister. The 13-year-old Carrera twins and their friend Ella Adames, also 13, know that being a teenager can also mean self-doubt, comparison, and other struggles that are only heightened by social media.

There are some services that offer navigation, like MapMyIndia and a few more, but none refined enough to guide you on a daily basis on your mobile device. There are plenty of reasons why Google Maps has been the ultimate stop for most users globally. The biggest probably has to be because the app comes preloaded on every Android-powered device.

Unsurprisingly, that proved to be popular – and unsustainable. MoviePass saw repeated waves of bad publicity, as the economics of the product were upended multiple times to cap usage and limit just how much the company was forced to pay out of pocket to sustain the service.

Kia describes the exterior design as 'bold' and we can't say we disagree with that. Chunky and borderline menacing, the strong proportions – and, in particular, the swollen front and rear wheel arches – are enhanced with crisp cut-lines that give the Concept EV9 the look of something hewn from solid metal blocks.

That is, whether it should include provisions changing the law to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, with caps on payments set based on prices paid by other wealthy nations. Concerns about such an extensive, centralized program are not unreasonable. On the other hand, patent reform is a market-friendly approach that embraces the benefits of competition and free entry to cut costs and better align the incentives for new drug development.

Rana bore the brunt of the collision, suffering life-changing brain and spinal-cord injuries. The 24-year-old spent months clinging to life, a ventilator helping him breathe, his family unsure if he'd ever leave the hospital.

Radford collaborated with British luxury watchmaker Bremont in creating a retro-modern interior harking back to classic Lotus racing cars. And without mincing words, we like it a lot. Inside the Radford Lotus Type 62-2 is a meaty three-spoke steering wheel. If you look closer, the spokes are carbon fiber as the rest of the car. You'll also find a carbon fiber center console housing a shift lever with exposed linkages like in a Pagani Huayra.

The asteroid is a quasi-satellite, which is a group of near-Earth asteroids that orbit the sun close to Earth. Researchers know very little about this class of objects overall because they are very faint and hard to observe. Astronomers utilizing the PanSTAARS telescope in 2016 discovered Kamo`oalewa and chose its name. The name comes from a Hawaiian creation chant and suggests offspring that travels alone.

[Technological change and domestic outsourcing](https://www.oecd.org/publications/technological-change-and-domestic-outsourcing-e3b226da-en.htm)


> Technological change and domestic outsourcing Domestic outsourcing has grown substantially in developed countries over the past two decades. This paper addresses the question of the technological drivers of this phenomenon by studying the impact of the staggered diffusion of broadband internet in France during the 2000s. Our results confirm that broadband technology increases firm productivity and the relative demand for high-skill workers. Further, we show that broadband internet led firms to outsource some non-core occupations to service contractors, both in the low and high-skill segments.

> New Delhi: In May this year, Facebook rolled out a new feature that would allow its users to hide their public like counts. In a nutshell, this meant that if a person so chooses, others cannot see how many ‘likes' or reactions their posts have received. In a blog post explaining the decision, the company said that the decision was taken after testing to see if hiding these counters would ‘depressurise' people's experience on Instagram. 'What we heard from people and experts was that not seeing like counts was beneficial for some and annoying to others,' it said.

It remains the only one of its category with an extremely high price tag (several thousand dollars/pounds) and lacking newer technology, like HDMI 2.1.This may all change in 2022 though. TechRadar Pro contacted a number of monitor vendors - and Dell rivals - that have confirmed plans to release 8K - and/or 5K monitors - in 2022. A spokesperson for Benq said their models are likely to arrive in Q2 2022 at the earliest while NEC - reinforced by its partnership with Sharp - confirmed that 8K displays are on its future roadmap.

But with its recent launch of an animated series for Netflix, you might assume that the company is following a more conventional narrative – to show the world that a game that stars, in the words of one its staffers, a 'magical sci-if gerbil', can play in the grown-up universe of Hollywood. Maybe. Rather than simply turning over its intellectual property to established TV pros, Riot went the figure-it-out-yourself route for its new series Arcane – entrusting it to staffers with zero experience in the world of network animation.

Even today, when the potato harvest comes in each year, a 90-kilogramme sack sells for just 2,000 Kenyan shillings (RM74) in the local market, as supplies soar, he said. Four months later, the same sack is worth three times as much – but small-scale farmers have already sold their crops, fearing rot if they try to hold onto them. 'Farmers have never been able to negotiate,' Kisilu said.

Take, for example, this Moto G Power (2022) that will be launching early next year with specs seemingly hailing from last year. Granted, not all of the hardware features packed into this phone are old, just that they sound old by today's standards, not to mention next year's.

There is, of course, Samsung with its tablet-like Galaxy Z Fold 3 and its clamshell Galaxy Z Flip 3, but there is also Microsoft with the new and improved Surface Duo 2. The latter represents a rather interesting take on the foldable idea, especially since it's really foldable only in the mechanical sense. It also has its inescapable drawbacks, however, and a new Samsung patent may have an alternative, though one that might become a reality any time soon.

And then device makers started switching to punch-hole cutouts, and some even started hiding front cameras underneath screens. It seems, however, that the notch trend might be arriving on large screens, like Apple's new MacBook Pros, and Samsung might try to make it a thing on tablets with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra.

But offerings planned for later this year, such as those by payments rival MobiKwik and hotel aggregator OYO, will face questions after Paytm's debut plunge of more than 27%, as investors turned queasy at its lack of profits and lofty value.

> Without question, the DeLorean DMC-12 is as iconic as the Back to the Future movie series. But the hardworking geniuses at Salvage2Savage wanted to make a massive splash at the recently concluded SEMA show, so they came up with the next best thing. Starting with a wrecked DMC-12, Salvage2Savage went to work in creating Doc Emmet Brown's next ride. But unlike the movie car, this DMC-12 has no flux capacitor generating 1.21 gigawatts of power. It doesn't have the stock V6 engine, either. Instead, it has a rear-mounted 5.

> Polish automotive design studio Carlex Design is an expert in turning 'the standard to unique.' However, its Jaguar XJ-C restomod is nothing short of a masterpiece. Other restomods like the new-age Opel Manta or Hyundai Pony Heritage have vintage body styles with electrified powertrains, and that's nice. But other restomods like the Ferrari Testarossa by Officine Fiovaranti and the Shelby MKIII-R by Superperformance pay homage to good old dinosaur juice. Carlex Design's Jaguar XJ-C belongs to the latter group, but it's not the typical 4.

> The Russia incident was a warning. On a winter morning in 2013, a meteor the size of a four-story building screamed across the country, exploding near the city of Chelyabinsk and injuring more than 1,600 people amid widespread property damage. The chunk of rock and iron, which was 60 feet across, served as a violent reminder that Earth, bombarded daily with tons of space-going debris, periodically intersects with large planet killers – and a significant portion of those remain undocumented. After years of study and discussion, Nasa has launched its first effort to spare Earth the kind of calamity that extinguished the dinosaurs, crashing a space probe into an asteroid to alter its speed and course.

Where coal-fired power has left ugly patches, the eco-balance is to become spotlessly clean. "When we say that we are delivering a carbon-neutral vehicle, this naturally includes battery cell production," says Thomas Ulbrich, member of the VW Board of Management and responsible for E-Mobility. But what about battery materials? Ulbrich doesn't seem to have anything new to say about the disposal of batteries.

> Years back, it was easy to find vehicles with manual transmissions. Most models had a budget-friendly manual-transmission option that many people chose for fuel economy. In modern times, automatic transmissions are more fuel-efficient, and people who know how to drive a manual and choose that type of transmission are declining. You might think that only sports cars aimed at enthusiasts would come with manual transmissions today, and while they do, other non-enthusiast rides still allow you to row your own gears.

> LISBON, Portugal: Portugal's new law on working from home makes the European Union country sound like a workers' paradise. Companies can't attempt to contact their staff outside working hours. They must help staff pay for their home gas, electric and Internet bills. Bosses are forbidden from using digital software to track what their teleworkers are doing. There's just one problem: the law might not work. Critics say the new rules are half-baked, short on detail and unfeasible. And they may even backfire by making companies reluctant to allow working from home at all.

> The price of the iPhone 13 rose from 11,999 liras (RM4,010) to 14,999 liras (RM5,013), an increase of 25%, which is above the official annual inflation rate of 19.89% in October. — Bloomberg ISTANBUL: Instead of Black Friday discounts, consumers in Turkey were faced with steep price hikes for Apple products after the value of the lira hit new record lows last week. Certain Apple devices were 25% more expensive than usual on Nov 26 – with some increases worth more than the local minimum wage. Persistent double digit inflation and the weakness of the Turkish currency has eroded the purchasing power of Turkish consumers, leading to a cost of living crisis and pressure on the government to act.

Douglas Blackiston and Sam Kriegman/Harvard Though life abounds, it nearly universally replicates in the same way — by growing, then eventually 'shedding,' offspring. The xenobots detailed in the new study (via PNAS), however, are able to produce a new generation of offspring in a different way.

> Bethesda's Starfield is still a year away, but ever since E3 2021, the company has been slowly teasing new details about the game. Today, the company published what is presumably the first in a series of developer diaries called 'Into the Starfield.' While the first episode doesn't really get into specifics about the game, Bethesda boss Todd Howard does drop a particularly tantalizing tease at the end. How Starfield sticks to the Bethesda formula Most of the discussion in this first episode of Into the Starfield is less about the game itself and more about the high-level concepts behind it.

Once the world's biggest mobile manufacturer at the turn of the 21st century, the company was nearly wiped out of the smartphone market by Apple's iPhone and Google's Android well before 2010, and ultimately sold its handset division to Microsoft in 2013. When news broke of Microsoft's takeover on TV, Finnish director Maarit Lalli's first thought was, 'There's going to be only one (drama) on Nokia in Finland: It will either be me or someone else, and it's most likely going to be made by a man,' she told Variety during a set visit in Helsinki.

> Many people out there want a performance car, but they can't live with two doors for various reasons. Anyone who owns a two-door sports car or muscle car knows that getting people, pets, and other items in and out of a two-door is very difficult. Thankfully, there are a few four-door cars out there that offer performance and convenience. Back at the beginning of the year, a rumor floated around that Toyota was working on a four-door performance car known as the GR Corolla. Toyota/Instagram That rumor has since been confirmed.

> Rumors about the iPhone 14 started popping up online before the iPhone 13 was announced — and though we don't yet know what Apple has planned, there's enough info floating around to speculate. The company is rumored to be working on a foldable iPhone, at least based on certain patents, but there's no guarantee a folding model is in the pipeline at this time. In all likeliness, the next iteration of the iPhone will be called the iPhone 14 and it'll stick to the trusted form factor from previous years.

[It's official, ADSL works over wet string](https://www.revk.uk/2017/12/its-official-adsl-works-over-wet-string.html)


> Broadband services are a wonderful innovation of our time, using multiple frequency bands (hence the name) to carry signals over wires (usually copper, sometimes aluminium). One of the key aspects of the technology is its ability to adapt to the length and characteristics of the line on which it is deployed. We have seen faults on broadband circuits that manifest as the system adapting to much lower speeds, this is a key factor as a service can work, but unusually slowly, over very bad lines. It has always been said that ADSL will work over a bit of wet string.

> One of the most magical, though at times unsettling, experiences on Earth is experiencing a total solar eclipse. These rare events happen when the moon passes in front of the sun and fully blocks out our star's light. A shadow is cast on Earth in areas where the eclipse is occurring. For those perfectly situated under the shadow where the moon covers 100 percent of the sun (called the path of totality), it's a bizarre, relatively sudden transition from light to darkness."The sky becomes very dark, as if it were dawn or dusk," notes NASA.

> German tuning expert Manhart has a dilemma. Electrification is at the core of Mercedes-AMG's incoming 2022 C63 and C63 S, and it will no longer have its fabulous 4.0-liter bi-turbo V8 engine. Manhart claims the newest C63 will probably come with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-banger and an electric motor. 'The (V8) engine's farewell is approaching,' said Manhart. And even though it will have around 650 horsepower, it won't have the sound and fury of AMG's thunderous V8. The solution is to live in the present without dwelling on the future, which is the principle behind Manhart's CR 700 Wagon.

The rather horrifying truth is that almost anything about a person that can be transmitted in a digital manner can be used to create a profile of that person, often for targeted marketing purposes. That especially includes the places you've been to, which is why location tracking has been a very thorny subject as far as privacy issues go. That's why it's a bit worrying that the popular Bluetooth tracker Tile might be acquired by a company that is now allegedly violating its own users' privacy, which is ironic given the nature of Life360's business.

> Even before Microsoft and Amazon announced their partnership to bring Android apps to Windows 11, creators have been working on ways to bridge the platforms. There are generic virtual machines, for example, but there are also more dedicated apps and services that try to simplify the process of installing and running Android apps on Windows. The most prominent of those products is perhaps BlueStacks, a service more geared toward games than every other sort of Android app. Google might be making that business obsolete next year when it brings Google Play Games, and therefore Android games, officially to Windows.

> The complaints detail harassment from male colleagues and supervisors as well as a lack of response from Tesla when the claims were reported internally. — AFP Tesla Inc's factory in Fremont, California, is more like a crude frat house than a facility owned by a cutting-edge company in the heart of a progressive region, six women who are current and former employees claimed in the latest barrage of lawsuits to hit Tesla over alleged sexual harassment. 'Although Tesla publicly claims that it fosters a safe and respectful environment for its workers, the truth is that for years Tesla has subjected women working in its Fremont factory facilities to nightmarish conditions of rampant sexual harassment,' according to the opening paragraph in each of the complaints filed Tuesday in Alameda County Superior Court.

However, the most important requirement for any building is to remain upright! Architects continue to push the boundaries of gravity, designing buildings that appear to define all written rules, often mysteriously and beautifully. All around the world, unique structures are created that seem to defy both gravity and logic.

The industry's first rollable phone, for example, would have come from LG, but will never come to pass. The company did promise it wouldn't immediately abandon owners of its existing phones, but its ability to stay on top of things hasn't exactly been reassuring.

> Published: Dec 16,202106:45 AM Electronic music is sometimes labeled robotic and one-dimensional, music that can only be enjoyed with the help of alcohol in a dark nightclub. This cliché extends to the idea that the genre originated in the 1980s when synthesizers and drum machines became integral to pop music. New York: But electronic music has had a long and diverse influence on the modern musical canon, a topic explored by the exhibition 'Electro. From Kraftwerk to Techno.' Now on show at the Kunstpalast in Dusseldorf — the city that incubated electronic music pioneers Kraftwerk — the exhibition maps the more than 100-year history of electronic music from its very beginnings to compositions by artificial intelligence.

One thing that has escaped smartwatch makers' grasp so far is measuring blood pressure, but even the likes of Fitbit are already trying to work on a cuff-less solution. Huawei might actually beat them to the punch, but its blood pressure measuring system won't exactly be as convenient as many might have imagined.

Sure, you can outsource, or host things on slices, or put things on a rack of Raspberry Pis and call it a day.

I spend a lot of time in the community speaking to parents in the community about the three Big Bads; pornography, cyberbullying and sexting, but I am not anti-technology — in fact, I am quite a fan. There are loads of safety and social benefits to technology. Like money or alcohol (or the Kardashians), I don't think smartphones are evil in and of themselves. I think it's more about what you do with them … and, though I am aware and deal regularly with the dark side of media use amongst tweens, I also see opportunities for our kids to learn and grow into thoughtful digital citizens.

> Windows 11 preview build comes with native support for Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) which lets you run Android apps on the desktop without third-party emulators. Right now, you can download apps from the Amazon Appstore only as support for other stores is not available. Amazon's Appstore is not as huge as the Play Store and only a limited number of Android apps can be officially downloaded on Windows 11. Thankfully, you can use the command-line tool to install Android apps and even run the Windows Subsystem for Android on non-Insider PCs, as well as avoid using the WSA manager.

Although trading was wobbly and largely directionless for the first five months of the year, the journey lower was relentless from June onwards. The exchange rate fell from ~1.2250 to the ~1.1200 area as the ECB remained relatively dovish and the Fed took the first major steps towards policy normalization. During this time, EUR/USD broke below its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving average decisively, establishing lower highs and lower lows impeccably, a bearish sign according to technical analysis.

> Putting your IT infrastructure into the cloud seems to be the "in" thing. It's been around for a while, of course. And, like most things related to IT, there are tradeoffs to be made.My rough estimate is that the unit cost of provisioning a service on AWS is about 3 times that of a competent IT organization providing a similar service in house. Other people have come to the same number, and it hasn't really changed much over the last decade. (If you don't think 3x is right, consider what AWS' gross margin is.

> After nearly three months of wreaking destruction on La Palma with its lava, ash, and earthquakes, in recent days the Cumbre Vieja volcano fell silent on the island. Experts officially certified that the eruption was over on Christmas Day. Some media outlets, and even Spain's president, said it was the volcano's version of a holiday gift. Yet, it's difficult to think of anything that has caused such tragedy as being the gift-giving type. In reality, Cumbre Vieja's activity ceased 10 days ago, igniting feelings of cautious hope among the residents who experienced the volcano's longest eruption in 375 years.
