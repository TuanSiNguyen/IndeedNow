Expected to arrive on devices sometime in fall, Android 14 brings new features and APIs, as well as behavioral changes that might impact applications. The purpose of the developer preview is to help application developers learn about these changes and test their applications for compatibility issues. One of the security enhancements the platform update is set to bring is related to runtime receivers and builds on changes introduced in Android 13, when Google instructed developers to specify whether their application's registered broadcast receiver should be visible to other apps on the device.

[What is a Pentester?](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/what-is-a-pentester/)


> With the cost of data breaches at an all-time high, organizations are working to proactively identify areas of risk on the network. Using pentesters to conduct penetration (pen) testing is becoming more common. To protect themselves, businesses must know their risk areas before hackers find vulnerabilities. Organizations can lower their attack risk by protecting against weaknesses or eliminating them. The 2022 IBM Cost of a Data Breach found that data breaches cost an average of $4.35 million per breach, an increase of 12.

> Princeton CarbonWorks' high-end road wheels have to date focused primarily on aerodynamic performance, but with the debut of its new Alta 3532 model, the young brand is now trying to win the hearts (and wallets) of riders more focused on gram scales. Claimed weights vary a bit depending on the exact hubs and spokes used, but they're impressive whichever way you go, going as low as 1,094 g and topping out at 1,202 g – and that's for disc-brake carbon clinchers. Should you prefer tubulars, that brings you well below the 1 kg mark to just 950 g (claimed) per set.

> If you're shopping for a digital camera, sensor size is one of the first things you'll hear about. Chances are you've seen terms like 'crop sensor,' 'full frame,' and 'micro four-thirds' thrown around, but what do those terms actually mean? And is camera sensor size actually important? How Your Digital Camera Sensor Works A digital camera's sensor collects light and converts that light into an image.

> Intel's CPU roadmap is a bit murky. We've all seen various forms of it and generally know what to expect. However, in silicon manufacturing, many details are always TBD until the day it launches. For example, we know Meteor Lake will follow Raptor Lake, and Arrow Lake comes after that. The fly in the ointment is Meteor Lake might be mobile-only. If that happens, the true successor to Raptor Lake is Arrow Lake in 2024. Now a new leak suggests that is the case, and Arrow Lake will offer big gains across the board for desktop users, especially in efficiency.

> Metroid Prime is my favorite game of all time. It was the Super Mario 64 of Metroid , brilliantly ushering the sci-fi platformer series from 2D to 3D. Obviously, I was thrilled to hear about Nintendo's surprise release of Metroid Prime Remastered , which you can play right now. But I'll admit that I was a touch nervous to return to the game, which I hadn't played in years. Would it hold up? In my first hour with Remastered , the answer so far is definitely yes.  I was overcome by waves of nostalgia from the moment I booted up the game.

These organizations were multinational global institutions that operated in a plethora of countries. One of the challenges that was common in these organizations was ensuring we complied with each jurisdiction's information and cybersecurity regulations. In practice, that work involved managing relationships with, in some cases, more than 250 regulatory authorities, each of which came with its own expectations of standards for cybersecurity best practice.

> Hi everybody! I'm new here and would really appreciate your advice. My knowledge about hardware and customization is not that good. My old MacBook Pro from 2015 needs an upgrade, and I am looking at the new MacBook Pro 14'' with M2 Max. I use my MacBook for a lot of graphic design, video editing and sports analysis. All of them uses some quite heavy software that uses a lot of power. I need my new MacBook to be able to process videos etc. as fast as even possible, and I do really not like lagging or bad performance! My idea is to (hold on now) upgrade it almost as much as possible: - M2 Max with 12‑core CPU, 38‑core GPU, 16‑core Neural Engine - 96GB unified memory - 4TB SSD storage The price is not an issue for me (no, I am really not rich), because I am willing to invest in really good performance for the years to come.

> A few days ago, a US fighter jet shot down a Chinese spy balloon that had entered US airspace over the Atlantic Ocean. Why are spy balloons used as a substitute for satellites in intelligence gathering and surveillance missions? Spy balloons are huge blimps, each about the size of three buses, that float higher than commercial airliners or even higher than fighter and spy planes. But these balloons fly at a much lower altitude than satellites that are at a higher altitude in Earth orbit. Most commercial airliners float during their flights at an altitude of 40,000 feet, while the Chinese balloon was within American territory, floating at an altitude of nearly 60,000 feet, and was maneuverable and showed that it could change its course.

A new video by Max Tech (opens in new tab) put the 2023 Mac Mini with M2 Pro head-to-head with Apple's 2019 workstation PC, and the results are both shocking and not a little infuriating for those who dropped the down payment on a house's worth of cash to buy Apple's premier workstation just three years ago.

This involves building a project of their choice, then open-sourcing and sharing what they've learnt and demoing the project. Quite often the HOP demos are run on the EP's local machine, for various reasons: cost of hosting, complexity of infrastructure, lack of experience with DevOps, and to make it easier for the EP to spend more time on the project. At Commit we're always keenly focused on enhancing the Engineer experience, so we're motivated to offer EPs an easier and better way to showcase their projects and learnings.

Software Configuration Management (SCM) is used less today than Version Control Systems (VCS) is. A simpler still term - 'Source Control' - seems to be used more recently, too. Similarly, ‘trunk' and ‘branch', have not always been used as terms for controlled code lines that have a common ancestor, and are eminently (and repeatably) mergeable.

Yahoo, which is owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management since a $5 billion buyout in 2021, added that the move would enable the company to narrow its focus and investment on its flagship ad business called DSP, or demand-side platform.

> A week after Twitter made the announcement about shutting down free access to the API, the company said today that it will charge $100 per month for the basic tier of API. This will get developers access to a 'low level of API usage' — without specifying what that exactly means — and the Ads API. The company had planned to shut down free access to its API on February 9, and now it has extended this deadline to February 13. But with no details available around API pricing restructuring and access levels, this extension seems symbolic as developers won't be able to plan their changes.

The way of use is even different. Some teams dropped 4-5 teams in one breath just to acquire a player. The Bucks paid 5 teams to the Nets because of Jae Crowder, and the Eagles also used 5 teams to grab the Pistons. Saddiq Bey , the Lakers Thomas Bryant also made the Nuggets willing to pull out 3.

> Hi, I wanted to use the erase all content and features setting on my m1 air due to some suspicious behaviors, and I was just wondering if whether this was safe to do so due to the following circumstances. My school uses eduoram which is encrypted and secured wifi, but to get to this connection you have to first connect to the unencrypted http legacy network for it to prompt you to download an application that would essentially allow you to connect to the encrypted network. If I were to reset my mac, it would redownload mac os itself connected to the http legacy network upon setting it back up because I cant download the application to get on the encrypted network before the device is getting set up and the mac uses wifi to download the OS again.

> Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share Millions of people will carve out time this Sunday to watch Super Bowl 57, where the Philadelphia Eagles will hopefully cream the Kansas City Chiefs in Arizona's State Farm stadium.

Broadcast rights for the big game have fallen to Fox in 2023, and the company has made it surprisingly easy to tune in. You don't even need a TV subscription — the company will live-stream the Super Bowl free on FoxSports.

There are two aspects to a computer's power: the number of operations its hardware can execute per second and the efficiency of the algorithms it runs.

But at least compared to other franchises, Konami still seems to be paying attention to this one franchise. It still exists as an animated series on Netflix which ends up coming in fantastic quality. The good news again? Konami doesn't seem to mind collaborating with other developers who are interested in working on content with it. Something that spawned a super cool collaboration with Dead Cells! Coming as a surprise last year, confirmation of the presence of Castlevania content as DLC for the super fun and cool rogue-like game – Dead Cells is indeed welcomed.

> George Santos is one of those liars who just can't stop, even when he's on a live Newsmax broadcast. When questioned about just where he got his $700,000-plus campaign funds, the New York Congressman tried to skirt the question by "attesting" that the money was "all legitimate." But when cornered for specifics, he stepped back into his comfort zone with yet another whopper, neglecting to do his math first: "Devolder Organizations was founded in 2001 when I stepped away from my previous employment and I decided to go on my own to do exactly what I did for other companies for years …" Um, if Google is correct in saying the imposter was born in 1988, that would make him around 12 or 13 years old when he left another job to strike it rich on his own.

> For years now we have felt the need for way to compare the relative sizes of different phones. We looked into making tool with static images, but that never seemed like the right solution. Instead, we worked with our partners at Binkies 3D to build on the 3D viewer we launched a few years ago to let you view two phones side by side and examine them from all angles. You can pick from a list of over 700 (and growing) phones and view them side-by-side with another phone. Just use our regular compare feature, putting the iPhone 14 Pro and Galaxy S23 side by side, for example, and you will see the new 3D Size Up buttons that let you jump straight into 3D view.

While many believe that lidar will be mostly used in autonomous driving, lidar has found a large spot already in current vehicles for uses in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and other safety and navigation systems. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges. The near-infrared lasers map the land and sends this real-time map back to the automotive system and sensors to react and control the vehicle appropriately.

For instance, the traveling salesperson problem, which asks for the shortest path needed to visit every city in a network only once, is NP-hard. So is determining whether a graph — a collection of vertices connected by edges — can be labeled with at most three colors so that any two connected vertices have different colors.

The chat AI ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI and largely financed by Microsoft, triggered real panic at the competitor Google because the search engine giant officially declared the internal red alert.

As a cybersecurity writer, I quickly add new strains to my vocabulary. But I never knew how they came to have those names in the first place. After writing numerous articles on malware, I decided to dig deep into the naming conventions to shed some light on that question. As it turns out, a name can tell you a lot about the malware itself — but it can also sow some confusion.

> New York CNN  —  The sports gambling gold rush is coming at a high cost. In 2018, the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on commercial sports betting in most of the country. Thirty-three states have made sports gambling legal in the wake of the decision. Now, on Super Bowl Sunday, a record 50.4 million US adults are expected to bet on the game. The booming sports betting industry, lawmakers and even the professional sports leagues themselves are making it easier, faster and more tempting for people to bet on games — and develop gambling problems, say gambling researchers and addiction specialists.

The big opportunity you were made to get excited about suddenly evaporates, or the new relationship you thought was really gaining traction vanishes into thin air. If these scenarios sound familiar to you, it's likely you've been ‘breadcrumbed'. Hansel and Gretel associations aside, put simply, ‘breadcrumbing' involves leading someone on, and keeping their hopes up through small and superficial acts of interest.

> The US government has a real issue with TikTok. On the surface, that could be attributed to the increasingly Sinophobic stance of US economic policy (with its ever more hardline Anti-Chinese attempts to 'rebalance' the semiconductor supply chain), but representatives from both major parties see the social media platform as a threat to US national security, and in December, 2022, it was banned from all government-issue smartphones . 'Ban TikTok!' demands FCC Commissioner On the surface then, news that in the summer of 2022, 1,704 TikTok accounts were used as part of a pro-Russian network to spread misinformation, disinformation and anti-Ukraine sentiment as a way to influence the way people viewed the illegal Russian invasion of that country, supports the idea that the US government is right to regard TikTok as a potential threat.

> Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain With its uncanny ability to mimic human language and reasoning, ChatGPT seems to herald a revolution in artificial intelligence. The nimble chatbot can conjure poems and essays, share recipes, translate languages, dispense advice, and tell jokes, among the endless applications users have tested since the Silicon Valley research lab OpenAI released the natural language-processing tool in November. With the excitement comes some trepidation—that the technology could degrade authentic human writing and critical thinking, upend industries, and amplify our own prejudices and biases.

> Google is flailing. After years of singleminded worship of the false god Virtual Assistant, the company is rushing its AI strategy as its competitors join their hands and raise their pitchforks. The irony is it's all happening because Google thought it had the pitchfork market cornered. See, in 2017, Google researchers published the article 'Attention is all you need,' introducing the concept of the transformer and vastly improving the capabilities of machine learning models. You don't need to know the technical side of it (and indeed I am not the one to teach you), but it has been enormously influential and empowering; let it suffice to say that it's the T in GPT.

The former employee , who asked to remain anonymous to protect future job prospects, wasn't going to be the one to tell their old colleagues.

Experts say the shallow intensity of the two earthquakes was more than older buildings would be able to withstand.

Gale Crater was once Gale Lake, a brimming body of water that could have given rise to microbial life in the first billion years of Martian history, before the planet lost most of its atmosphere and water to space. If you want to find clues to exobiology, a place like Gale is where to start looking. Now, as NASA reports, Gale Crater is proving itself to be an even more fertile spelunking spot than once believed.

> When it comes to running Kubernetes in the cloud, one of the most significant costs can come from using a load balancer for each service. With prices starting at around $15 per month per load balancer, it's easy for costs to quickly add up, especially if you have a large number of pods. However, what if we told you that there's a way to run Kubernetes without the need for a load balancer and still get the benefits of high availability and automatic failover? In this article, we'll explore how you can achieve cost savings in the cloud by running Kubernetes without a load balancer.

Earlier this week, Apple was granted a patent (US-11571048-B1) for an Apple Watch strap release mechanism that could potentially be used with a built-in camera. That, on its own, is a neat idea, but it's also the third camera-related Apple Watch patent we've seen in recent years. The patent application was originally filed in 2019, so Apple engineers have clearly had wearable cameras on the brain for some time.

> Targeted policies and incentives do speed the uptake of electric vehicles. Credit: Shutterstock The ACT is changing how it calculates car registration fees . Instead of being based on a car's weight, the fee the owner pays will be based on the greenhouse gas emissions it produces. Up to now, owners of cleaner but typically heavier electric vehicles have paid more for registration than those of high-polluting but lighter vehicles powered by petrol or diesel engines. Emissions-based fees will reverse that situation.

As predicted based on a leaked and then modified support page, you can no longer use your parents' Netflix account if you don't live with them — unless they shell out extra cash every month ($7.

The phenomenon draws many parallels to presenteeism , which describes showing up for work to keep up appearances but getting very little done due to sickness or emotional challenges. Both concepts are born from workplace dissatisfaction and anxieties over job security, but unlike presenteeism, resenteeism describes a less guarded expression of similar frustrations. Resentful employees tend to be more active about their concerns, and put simply, are no longer afraid of hiding them.

From my understanding, the distance represents the square root of the difference of the error sum of squares of two clusters once they are merged minus the sum of the error sum of squares of each individual cluster.

Customers searching for inexpensive and mid-range choices might choose from a variety of Nord devices. Then came the T smartphones, followed by the R devices with the OnePlus 9 series, which were more affordable than the top flagship models.  Without a question, the company does its best to cram as much as it can into their devices to provide clients a fantastic experience.

To be honest, even on the weekend I can't play as much as I'd like, since adult life comes with other responsibilities and other things that, in the end, end up forcing you to leave those hobbies that you love a little more in the background.

> Even with all of the movie streaming services of today, I often have a hard time deciding on what to watch. A Good Movie To Watch is a site that lists highly rated yet little-known shows and movies. Browse by a curated list of the "best" films, or by category. I clicked on the "dark" mood category, and spotted some films I'd enjoyed a long time ago and would  love to rewatch such as Re-Animator (1985)  and Monster (2003) . Although you can't watch the movies directly from the site, I much prefer searching for ways to watch a specific option I have in mind than to waste time browsing the limited options on Netflix, only to give up and call off watching a movie all-together.

From overzealous marketing and worries about damaged battery longevity to handsets that simply charge too slowly, it seems like few brands actually get charging just right. Samsung is no different. Despite advertising 45W wired charging power since 2022's flagships, it turned out to be a brief peak rather than a sustainable power level last year. The result has been handsets that mostly have solid battery life but whose cells refill barely any faster than they did when charging at the older power levels.

[Still worth buying A12z iPad Pro in 2023](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/still-worth-buying-a12z-ipad-pro-in-2023.2380406/)


> I want to switch from an 11' ipad pro to a 12.9'. Is it worth getting a A12Z iPad Pro, or I should only consider an M1 model? My plan is to buy from Apple refurbished. I can sell my old ipad for £275 and A12Z model is £579. It looks like the M1 model is about to appear on Apple refurbished store at £849 so my cost to upgrade will be nearly double. For browsing, streaming and Facetime is it worth the extra cost? Personally, having both the non mini-LED and the mini-LED version, I don't care much about the difference in screen, but some people do and they go crazy about it.

> A significant deposit of lithium, a rare metal used in the manufacturing of batteries for electronic devices and electric vehicles, has been discovered in India. The deposit is estimated to be 5.9 million tonnes in the Salal-Haimana area of Reasi District of Jammu & Kashmir (UT), making it one of the largest deposits of lithium in the world. "The unavailability of Lithium has been one of the reasons why India has been dependent on other countries for Li-Ion batteries and other EV components. Lithium being one of the core elements of the Li-Ion batteries and taking into consideration the financial impact of sourcing Lithium, the recent discovery of Lithium reserves in J&K does come in as a new lease of life as it further enables India's ambition to become self-sufficient in its energy storage needs,' Pankaj Sharma, Co-Founder and Director of Log9 Materials said.

The company's India arm is also hyping the launch event— which is taking place in London— on social media as well as official website so we have reason to believe the Find N2 is coming to India sooner rather than later. But we'll see. The Find N2 is a folding flip phone on the lines of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4. Oppo says that it is better in two ways: the Find N2 Flip seemingly has an invisible crease and it has the 'largest-ever cover screen on a flip phone'.

Well, it's not as simple as that, but the Austrian company, founded by Dr. Gregor Tegel, Dr. Günther Bochmann and Dr. Simon Rittmann, claims to be the only company creating 20 proteinogenic amino acids by feeding carbon dioxide to single-celled micro-organisms called archaea – without the need for genetic engineering. So what was behind Arkeon's creation? Most alternative protein startups rally behind achieving circularity and promoting sustainability in food production.
