> While there are plenty of espresso makers out in the market, it's rare that you see a machine dedicated to making Turkish coffee. If you're a fan of this thick, strong brew, then the Beko Telvo Duo Turkish Coffee Machine is definitely something to have in your kitchen.What's impressive about it is that it makes enough Turkish coffee to serve six people, and while that might be great for larger gatherings, it's a bit of overkill if you just occasionally want a single cup. This also means that the machine is larger than most single-brew machines, so you'll need to have enough counter space to keep it handy.

During the Apple event, we got a new entry-level iPad, iPad mini 6, Apple Watch Series 7, and iPhone 13. While the Series 7 and iPhone 13 were definitely expected, I believe most of us were shocked that Apple decided to start off with the new iPad lineup.

> I wasn't sure what to expect from Kena: Bridge of Spirits. Developer Ember Lab's adorable adventure caused quite a stir when it was revealed at the PlayStation Future of Gaming showcase in 2020 Following a delay, it felt like Kena retreated into the shadows a bit - leaving some anxiety about whether it would still meet its new release date of September 21, and whether it would fall at the final hurdle many highly-anticipated releases have in the last couple of years.Developing a game in the current climate is a heavy cross to bear, particularly for a smaller studio like Ember.

> Source: Android Central I previewed Kena: Bridge of Spirits shortly before E3 2021. At the time, I only had an hour or so with the game, but felt confident that it was shaping up to be something special. After spending some more time with the final build, I'm happy that my initial impressions appear to be right. I haven't wanted to put the controller down since I started. Kena's characters and world hold such a charm that it's hard not to love them, and the gameplay continues to evolve throughout so that progression feels natural and earned.

Many models simply bump around, chaotically criss-crossing your floors until their battery runs low. This can result in clean floors, but you may find random spots that the vacuum completely missed, and these more basic robot vacuums may not always find their way back to their charging base to be ready for the next job (which could be needed right away if it missed a lot of spots).

> The Far Cry series has been no stranger to controversy. From criticism over Far Cry 4's cover art to the petition over Far Cry 5's portrayal of religious fanatics as villains, Ubisoft's long-running series is often contentious, to say the least, and Far Cry 6 is no different.Set on the fictional island of Yara, Far Cry 6 sees players taking on the role of Dani Rojas, who joins a guerrilla revolution against Yara's tyrannical dictator, Anton Castillo (played by Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito). It's a dark premise, but one that Ubisoft plans to balance with the chaotic, playground mechanics that the Far Cry series is known for – a balancing act that has already garnered criticism from some.

Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey recently analyzed seeds stuck in the footprints to determine their approximate age, ranging from around 22,800 and 21,130 years ago.The findings may shed light on a mystery that has long intrigued scientists: When did people first arrive in the Americas, after dispersing from Africa and Asia?Most scientists believe ancient migration came by way of a now-submerged land bridge that connected Asia to Alaska.

> It's time to take the first look at the recently introduced iPhone 13 series. The phones go on sale in India from today although we hear and see that the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max may hit the market only in limited quantity.

The price starts from Rs 69,990 and goes up to Rs 1,79,990.

He was citing David Leonhardt's New York Times newsletter. Biden and Leonhardt frame the statistic as encouraging: only 1 in 5,000. But it isn't good news or bad news. It's essentially meaningless. What's more important is knowing that when community spread of the coronavirus is high, the risk of breakthrough infection needs to be taken seriously, which means combining vaccination with other public health measures.

James Bond.'It's nearly six decades since Sean Connery first uttered those immortal words in Dr No, and 24 (official) movies and six actors later, the Bond series remains one of the most popular franchises in movie history.But with all those missions to choose from, working out how to watch the James Bond movies in order isn't quite as simple as it might seem. Sure, you could view them in release date order, but what if you prefer the quippy charm of Roger Moore to Sean Connery's more rugged portrayal of a government assassin? What if Daniel Craig, the current incumbent of the famous role, is your definitive 007? And what if you'd rather skip the more disappointing entries in the franchise entirely – A View to a Kill and Die Another Day, we have you in our sights…With the long-delayed 26th entry in the 007 series, No Time To Die, arriving in theaters on September 30 (UK)/October 8 (US), we've taken a tour through nearly 60 years of glamorous locales, femmes fatales and vodka martinis (shaken, not stirred, naturally) to explain how to watch the James Bond movies in order.

However, before you hand it over to someone else or drop it off at FedEx, there's still some work you'll need to do.

[Why are so few people actually using 5G in the U.S.? Here's what the experts say](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/5g-rollout-lagging-united-states/)


> Despite many devices boasting 5G capabilities these days, a recent study showed people in the U.S. spend less than 25% of their online time connected to a 5G network. This may be because 5G-enabled devices are outpacing 5G access. Last year, 14 million users subscribed to mobile 5G services, and the number was forecasted to grow to 554 million by the end of this year. Today, more than halfway into 2021, T-Mobile has already connected 305 million people with 5G networks. Along with T-Mobile, other major mobile operators like Verizon and AT&T were quick to roll out 5G in the last few months, collectively covering 75% of the U.

> So I am currently sharing my first video shot with cinematic video and thought I would share some thoughts and maybe spur some conversation. This was the absolute one feature I was looking forward to, and that with the "97%" more light back wide camera were enough to upgrade from my 12PM that I only got last December 26th. Just a few thoughts though. 1. Getting video off the phone is going to be a chore. In order to actually keep the depth effect, apple says you need to Airdrop or use the photos app, you cannot use iMazing or third party apps, the video just comes out as 1080p video with no depth effects.

At some point during the three-day spaceflight, an alarm alerted the four Crew Dragon passengers to an issue with — of all things — the toilet. A faulty space toilet may sound rather trivial when you consider other things that you really wouldn't want to go wrong while orbiting 357 miles (575 kilometers) above Earth. But the issue could've resulted in waste products floating around the spacecraft in the microgravity conditions, causing serious problems for those on board.

It follows a damning report by Facebook that revealed that Instagram was causing harm to the body image of young girls. According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal, internal documents from Facebook show the company was aware that it was having a detrimental affect on the mental health of teen girls.

> Source: Joe Maring / iMore Instagram owner Facebook has today announced plans to pause its planned Instagram Kids launch, allowing it time to build new parental supervision tools. In a press release penned by Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, Facebook says that it believes it's best to give kids access to a special version of Instagram, rather than them use the normal version. We firmly believe that it's better for parents to have the option to give their children access to a version of Instagram that is designed for them — where parents can supervise and control their experience — than relying on an app's ability to verify the age of kids who are too young to have an ID.

I have spent some time with all four models -- iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max -- but this review focuses on the standard iPhone 13 model.

Several users and Apple's partners, such as Verizon Communications Inc and Best Buy, have highlighted delays after pre-ordering began in September due to a shortage of supply and high demand, with analysts warning of one of the longest waiting times for the phone in recent years.

If the measure makes it to the November 2022 ballot and passes, drivers could end up earning as little as a quarter of the minimum wage, according to a University of California-Berkeley study published on Wednesday. The UC Berkeley Labor Center researchers, Ken Jacobs and Michael Reich, identified multiple loopholes that would change the guaranteed pay from $18 per hour to $4.

> If you're pondering the question of what makes for the best all-round gaming monitor, the new Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165 might just be the answer. On paper, at least.With a 32-inch 1440p panel running at up to 165Hz refresh, it arguably nails exactly the right balance between performance and graphical detail. Sure, there are gaming monitors with more pixels than the Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165. Others hum along at even higher refresh rates or offer more overall inches. But you quickly run into one obvious issue with ever-higher spec screens.

[Best 15-inch laptop 2021: top picks with 15-inch displays](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-15-inch-laptop)


> The best 15-inch laptops hit the sweet spot for most people between portability and practicality, making them ideal for business, school, or creative work on the go. They are often just as powerful as the best 17-inch laptop, while being able to fit into just about any backpack or tote bag when you're in a hurry as any of the best 13-inch laptops on the market right now.What's more, the best 15-inch laptops for gaming are also the smallest you can realistically get if you want to seriously game on the go, while productive users will find that anything less than 15 inches doesn't have the screen real estate to handle a moderately sized spreadsheet (and you can forget about that tenkey numpad on a 13-inch!).

The bladeless Haxson AirFan includes a heating mode, a formaldehyde sensor, and a purifier while maintaining a rather svelte profile. The HEPA filter should be able to stop contaminants like dust, smoke, pollen, and odor. On the audio side, the AirFan uses Bluetooth 5.0, and plays nice with both Alexa and Google Assistant. This allows you to ask the AirFan to dim its light, set an alarm, or answer inane trivia that's keeping you up in the middle of the night.

We'll show you how to opt in, set a predefined status, and set your custom status. How to turn on Chat in Gmail Right off the bat, if you don't have a chat tab at the bottom of Gmail, you do not have chat turned on yet, and you will not be able to set your status.

Several companies, including SpaceX and Amazon, have been working on similar tech, but have so far only been able to create connections by routing the satellite's signals through a physical terminal on Earth first.

The eruption is not in an area with homes and is entirely contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Officials said increased earthquake activity and ground swelling before the eruption put them on high alert. Fissures then opened in the summit area and sent lava fountaining into the sky. Now the area has filled with molten rock, creating a lake of lava in the volcano's crater. The new lava is an expected evolution of a volcano that is recharging after a huge eruption in 2018 drained much of its magma.

As for higher refresh rates, 144Hz and above, there seems to be very little demand for those (144/165Hz is typical of gaming hardware, both PC and smartphone).

However, as is common with high-profile iOS releases, iPhone users have been experiencing a highly annoying battery depletion problem following the introduction of iOS 15. According to a Tom's Guide article, the famous music streaming service Spotify could be to blame.

> E10 fuel economy: Drivers are being warned to save money by regulating their revs. Some drivers have expressed dissatisfaction with the new E10 gasoline's efficiency and fuel economy when compared to E5 gasoline. E10 gasoline has divided drivers since its launch in early September, with some hailing the environmental benefits and others noting that their car isn't as efficient. Using E10 gasoline reduces fuel economy by about 1%, however this is unlikely to be evident in ordinary driving. Other factors, such as driving style or driving with under-inflated tyres, have a far greater impact on fuel economy than the use of E10 gasoline.

> Ten years after Apple founder Steve Jobs' death, the company is a profit machine but some say it has lost its creative magic By Julie JAMMOT Ten years after Apple founder Steve Jobs' death, the firm has grown into a colossus of devices and services that is the world's most valuable company, but the tech legend's diehard fans lament its lost aura of revolution.

> It's starting to sound like the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro could be the most intriguing Pixel phones in a long time, with the company seemingly rebounding from its 2020 slump year that saw the less-than-interesting Pixel 4a, 4a 5G and 5.Even the recent Pixel 5a was a familiar-feeling phone, but by what rumors suggest - and what Google itself has said - the Pixel 6 range represents a big step up for the company.Google has officially revealed these handsets, and they look just like the leaks predicted: sleek devices with a visor-like camera block that splits the back cover in two.

The energy crisis that has engulfed most of Europe has generated tensions among EU member states.

Some member states have blamed Russia for limiting gas supplies on purpose, while others have blamed Brussels' ambitions for a green economic reform for the issue.

> If a company is hit with a major cyberattack, it may not be the only one that suffers. An organization's customers may also be vulnerable, and these attacks are hard to defend against. They are called supply chain attacks, in which, by attacking one major supplier, the hackers can reach its customers through striking less secure elements in a supply chain. One example is the cyberattack against the Israeli company Voicenter last month, which was hit by a group of foreign hackers. The cloud-based call center service provider counts companies like MobileEye, eToro, Check Point and Similar Web among its clients.

If you wait until Black Friday, the items that you purchase may not arrive on time, and they may even go on backorder if the product that you bought is a popular one.

[Best Squid Game memes: The show is serious, but these jokes are funny](https://www.cnet.com/news/best-squid-game-memes-the-show-is-serious-but-these-jokes-are-funny/)


> No doubt about it, the plot of the new Netflix drama, Squid Game, is nothing to laugh at. In the show, which might end up as the streaming service's biggest hit ever, financially strapped people compete in a tournament of kids' games where losers get killed. Not very funny. But the show has captured the public's imagination and as always, the memes and jokes have followed.  It's easy to see why -- Squid Game has many complex characters, as well as plenty of visually striking scenes and objects (the Dalgona cookies, the game organization's business card, the outfits).

However, there is no external source of revenue for those payoffs. Instead, the payoffs come entirely from new investment money, while the operators take away a large portion of this money. Investing in bitcoin (or any crypto with similar protocol) checks all these items. The investors are all those who have bought or will buy bitcoins; they invest by buying bitcoins, and cash out by selling them.

Generally speaking, the best iPhone game controller usually gives you better, well, control and can make playing for long stretches easier on mobile. That's why it's so upsetting that the game currently does not offer controller support. Can you use a controller in Pokémon Unite on iPhone and iPad? As ridiculous as it sounds, Pokémon Unite on mobile did not launch with controller support for either the iOS or Android versions.

But considering both tablets are about a year old with aging chipsets, we're eagerly anticipating when the new Galaxy Tab S8 will arrive. The last few Galaxy Tab S tablets were announced and launched in late summer, but Samsung is taking its time with the S8 series. This could be due to recent chip shortages, or because Samsung allegedly plans to release three new tablets this round, including a Tab S8 "Ultra" version that could go toe-to-toe with the iPad Pro in size and performance.

Physical games can be passed back and forth, but digital games technically stay connected to the Nintendo account and Switch console they were purchased on. If you buy a digital game on one Switch, it makes sense that you might want to share it on, say, your child's Switch for them to play. But is Gameshare possible? Technically, there is no official game-sharing service on Nintendo's systems.

Visa's neural network assesses more than 500 risk attributes in about a millisecond to predict every transaction's fraud probability. Data released by AusPayNet suggests it is working, as overall card fraud only rose 0.6% in 2020, even though online retail spending grew 44%. Enumeration attacks – an automated, brute force approach that guesses and tests payment credentials such as account numbers, CVV2, and/or expiry dates during online checkout – came to the fore locally and internationally during the past year.

A handful of other devices like the HP Elite Dragonfly Max business laptop also have 5-megapixel cameras but (a) they're likely to be 2-in-1 convertible laptops and (b) they still account for a tiny fraction of the market.So why is it that, in this day and age where hybrid working is all the rage, where Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Google Meet are household names and even mainstream smartphones (like the Infinix Zero 8) boast a selfie camera with 48-megapixel resolution, do laptop owners have to put up with VGA webcams (yes VGA)?VGA, for those below a certain age, refers to an antiquated, obsolete, bygone resolution of 640 by 480 pixels (or 307,000 pixels in all).

> TODAY'S BEST DEALSRemember when Sony cameras didn't even offer vloggers so much as an articulating screen? That wasn't long ago, but the Sony ZV-E10 is the latest in a growing line of video-centric Sony cameras that fixes this limitation, while neatly filling a gap between its entry-level (Sony ZV-1) and mid-range (Sony A6100) offerings.Like an A6100 spin-off with a video-tastic bod, the ZV-E10 is effectively two parts old internals and one-part new body, with a dash of souped-up software. What's even better is that this new entry wants to scratch your video itch without going over $1,000/ £1,000/ AUS $1,500 mark.

[Mystery of a strange mirrored double galaxy solved using Hubble data](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/hubble-mirrored-galaxy/)


> When telescopes like Hubble peer out into the cosmos, they can sometimes sneak a view of very distant objects using a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. This is where a massive object like a galaxy passes between a distant object and Earth, and the gravity of this intermediate object warps spacetime and acts as a magnifying glass. This allows astronomers to glimpse objects which would otherwise be too faint and far away to be visible. But sometimes these phenomena result in strange outcomes, like an oddity spotted by Hubble in 2013 which appeared to be two objects that were perfect mirror images of each other.
