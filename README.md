Expected to arrive on devices sometime in fall, Android 14 brings new features and APIs, as well as behavioral changes that might impact applications. The purpose of the developer preview is to help application developers learn about these changes and test their applications for compatibility issues. One of the security enhancements the platform update is set to bring is related to runtime receivers and builds on changes introduced in Android 13, when Google instructed developers to specify whether their application's registered broadcast receiver should be visible to other apps on the device.

[What is a Pentester?](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/what-is-a-pentester/)


> With the cost of data breaches at an all-time high, organizations are working to proactively identify areas of risk on the network. Using pentesters to conduct penetration (pen) testing is becoming more common. To protect themselves, businesses must know their risk areas before hackers find vulnerabilities. Organizations can lower their attack risk by protecting against weaknesses or eliminating them. The 2022 IBM Cost of a Data Breach found that data breaches cost an average of $4.35 million per breach, an increase of 12.

> Princeton CarbonWorks' high-end road wheels have to date focused primarily on aerodynamic performance, but with the debut of its new Alta 3532 model, the young brand is now trying to win the hearts (and wallets) of riders more focused on gram scales. Claimed weights vary a bit depending on the exact hubs and spokes used, but they're impressive whichever way you go, going as low as 1,094 g and topping out at 1,202 g – and that's for disc-brake carbon clinchers. Should you prefer tubulars, that brings you well below the 1 kg mark to just 950 g (claimed) per set.

> If you're shopping for a digital camera, sensor size is one of the first things you'll hear about. Chances are you've seen terms like 'crop sensor,' 'full frame,' and 'micro four-thirds' thrown around, but what do those terms actually mean? And is camera sensor size actually important? How Your Digital Camera Sensor Works A digital camera's sensor collects light and converts that light into an image.

> Intel's CPU roadmap is a bit murky. We've all seen various forms of it and generally know what to expect. However, in silicon manufacturing, many details are always TBD until the day it launches. For example, we know Meteor Lake will follow Raptor Lake, and Arrow Lake comes after that. The fly in the ointment is Meteor Lake might be mobile-only. If that happens, the true successor to Raptor Lake is Arrow Lake in 2024. Now a new leak suggests that is the case, and Arrow Lake will offer big gains across the board for desktop users, especially in efficiency.

> Metroid Prime is my favorite game of all time. It was the Super Mario 64 of Metroid , brilliantly ushering the sci-fi platformer series from 2D to 3D. Obviously, I was thrilled to hear about Nintendo's surprise release of Metroid Prime Remastered , which you can play right now. But I'll admit that I was a touch nervous to return to the game, which I hadn't played in years. Would it hold up? In my first hour with Remastered , the answer so far is definitely yes.  I was overcome by waves of nostalgia from the moment I booted up the game.

These organizations were multinational global institutions that operated in a plethora of countries. One of the challenges that was common in these organizations was ensuring we complied with each jurisdiction's information and cybersecurity regulations. In practice, that work involved managing relationships with, in some cases, more than 250 regulatory authorities, each of which came with its own expectations of standards for cybersecurity best practice.

> Hi everybody! I'm new here and would really appreciate your advice. My knowledge about hardware and customization is not that good. My old MacBook Pro from 2015 needs an upgrade, and I am looking at the new MacBook Pro 14'' with M2 Max. I use my MacBook for a lot of graphic design, video editing and sports analysis. All of them uses some quite heavy software that uses a lot of power. I need my new MacBook to be able to process videos etc. as fast as even possible, and I do really not like lagging or bad performance! My idea is to (hold on now) upgrade it almost as much as possible: - M2 Max with 12‑core CPU, 38‑core GPU, 16‑core Neural Engine - 96GB unified memory - 4TB SSD storage The price is not an issue for me (no, I am really not rich), because I am willing to invest in really good performance for the years to come.

> A few days ago, a US fighter jet shot down a Chinese spy balloon that had entered US airspace over the Atlantic Ocean. Why are spy balloons used as a substitute for satellites in intelligence gathering and surveillance missions? Spy balloons are huge blimps, each about the size of three buses, that float higher than commercial airliners or even higher than fighter and spy planes. But these balloons fly at a much lower altitude than satellites that are at a higher altitude in Earth orbit. Most commercial airliners float during their flights at an altitude of 40,000 feet, while the Chinese balloon was within American territory, floating at an altitude of nearly 60,000 feet, and was maneuverable and showed that it could change its course.

A new video by Max Tech (opens in new tab) put the 2023 Mac Mini with M2 Pro head-to-head with Apple's 2019 workstation PC, and the results are both shocking and not a little infuriating for those who dropped the down payment on a house's worth of cash to buy Apple's premier workstation just three years ago.

This involves building a project of their choice, then open-sourcing and sharing what they've learnt and demoing the project. Quite often the HOP demos are run on the EP's local machine, for various reasons: cost of hosting, complexity of infrastructure, lack of experience with DevOps, and to make it easier for the EP to spend more time on the project. At Commit we're always keenly focused on enhancing the Engineer experience, so we're motivated to offer EPs an easier and better way to showcase their projects and learnings.

Software Configuration Management (SCM) is used less today than Version Control Systems (VCS) is. A simpler still term - 'Source Control' - seems to be used more recently, too. Similarly, ‘trunk' and ‘branch', have not always been used as terms for controlled code lines that have a common ancestor, and are eminently (and repeatably) mergeable.

Yahoo, which is owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management since a $5 billion buyout in 2021, added that the move would enable the company to narrow its focus and investment on its flagship ad business called DSP, or demand-side platform.

> A week after Twitter made the announcement about shutting down free access to the API, the company said today that it will charge $100 per month for the basic tier of API. This will get developers access to a 'low level of API usage' — without specifying what that exactly means — and the Ads API. The company had planned to shut down free access to its API on February 9, and now it has extended this deadline to February 13. But with no details available around API pricing restructuring and access levels, this extension seems symbolic as developers won't be able to plan their changes.

The way of use is even different. Some teams dropped 4-5 teams in one breath just to acquire a player. The Bucks paid 5 teams to the Nets because of Jae Crowder, and the Eagles also used 5 teams to grab the Pistons. Saddiq Bey , the Lakers Thomas Bryant also made the Nuggets willing to pull out 3.

> Hi, I wanted to use the erase all content and features setting on my m1 air due to some suspicious behaviors, and I was just wondering if whether this was safe to do so due to the following circumstances. My school uses eduoram which is encrypted and secured wifi, but to get to this connection you have to first connect to the unencrypted http legacy network for it to prompt you to download an application that would essentially allow you to connect to the encrypted network. If I were to reset my mac, it would redownload mac os itself connected to the http legacy network upon setting it back up because I cant download the application to get on the encrypted network before the device is getting set up and the mac uses wifi to download the OS again.

> Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share Millions of people will carve out time this Sunday to watch Super Bowl 57, where the Philadelphia Eagles will hopefully cream the Kansas City Chiefs in Arizona's State Farm stadium.

Broadcast rights for the big game have fallen to Fox in 2023, and the company has made it surprisingly easy to tune in. You don't even need a TV subscription — the company will live-stream the Super Bowl free on FoxSports.

There are two aspects to a computer's power: the number of operations its hardware can execute per second and the efficiency of the algorithms it runs.

But at least compared to other franchises, Konami still seems to be paying attention to this one franchise. It still exists as an animated series on Netflix which ends up coming in fantastic quality. The good news again? Konami doesn't seem to mind collaborating with other developers who are interested in working on content with it. Something that spawned a super cool collaboration with Dead Cells! Coming as a surprise last year, confirmation of the presence of Castlevania content as DLC for the super fun and cool rogue-like game – Dead Cells is indeed welcomed.

> George Santos is one of those liars who just can't stop, even when he's on a live Newsmax broadcast. When questioned about just where he got his $700,000-plus campaign funds, the New York Congressman tried to skirt the question by "attesting" that the money was "all legitimate." But when cornered for specifics, he stepped back into his comfort zone with yet another whopper, neglecting to do his math first: "Devolder Organizations was founded in 2001 when I stepped away from my previous employment and I decided to go on my own to do exactly what I did for other companies for years …" Um, if Google is correct in saying the imposter was born in 1988, that would make him around 12 or 13 years old when he left another job to strike it rich on his own.

> For years now we have felt the need for way to compare the relative sizes of different phones. We looked into making tool with static images, but that never seemed like the right solution. Instead, we worked with our partners at Binkies 3D to build on the 3D viewer we launched a few years ago to let you view two phones side by side and examine them from all angles. You can pick from a list of over 700 (and growing) phones and view them side-by-side with another phone. Just use our regular compare feature, putting the iPhone 14 Pro and Galaxy S23 side by side, for example, and you will see the new 3D Size Up buttons that let you jump straight into 3D view.

While many believe that lidar will be mostly used in autonomous driving, lidar has found a large spot already in current vehicles for uses in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and other safety and navigation systems. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges. The near-infrared lasers map the land and sends this real-time map back to the automotive system and sensors to react and control the vehicle appropriately.

For instance, the traveling salesperson problem, which asks for the shortest path needed to visit every city in a network only once, is NP-hard. So is determining whether a graph — a collection of vertices connected by edges — can be labeled with at most three colors so that any two connected vertices have different colors.

The chat AI ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI and largely financed by Microsoft, triggered real panic at the competitor Google because the search engine giant officially declared the internal red alert.

As a cybersecurity writer, I quickly add new strains to my vocabulary. But I never knew how they came to have those names in the first place. After writing numerous articles on malware, I decided to dig deep into the naming conventions to shed some light on that question. As it turns out, a name can tell you a lot about the malware itself — but it can also sow some confusion.

> New York CNN  —  The sports gambling gold rush is coming at a high cost. In 2018, the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on commercial sports betting in most of the country. Thirty-three states have made sports gambling legal in the wake of the decision. Now, on Super Bowl Sunday, a record 50.4 million US adults are expected to bet on the game. The booming sports betting industry, lawmakers and even the professional sports leagues themselves are making it easier, faster and more tempting for people to bet on games — and develop gambling problems, say gambling researchers and addiction specialists.

The big opportunity you were made to get excited about suddenly evaporates, or the new relationship you thought was really gaining traction vanishes into thin air. If these scenarios sound familiar to you, it's likely you've been ‘breadcrumbed'. Hansel and Gretel associations aside, put simply, ‘breadcrumbing' involves leading someone on, and keeping their hopes up through small and superficial acts of interest.

> The US government has a real issue with TikTok. On the surface, that could be attributed to the increasingly Sinophobic stance of US economic policy (with its ever more hardline Anti-Chinese attempts to 'rebalance' the semiconductor supply chain), but representatives from both major parties see the social media platform as a threat to US national security, and in December, 2022, it was banned from all government-issue smartphones . 'Ban TikTok!' demands FCC Commissioner On the surface then, news that in the summer of 2022, 1,704 TikTok accounts were used as part of a pro-Russian network to spread misinformation, disinformation and anti-Ukraine sentiment as a way to influence the way people viewed the illegal Russian invasion of that country, supports the idea that the US government is right to regard TikTok as a potential threat.

> Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain With its uncanny ability to mimic human language and reasoning, ChatGPT seems to herald a revolution in artificial intelligence. The nimble chatbot can conjure poems and essays, share recipes, translate languages, dispense advice, and tell jokes, among the endless applications users have tested since the Silicon Valley research lab OpenAI released the natural language-processing tool in November. With the excitement comes some trepidation—that the technology could degrade authentic human writing and critical thinking, upend industries, and amplify our own prejudices and biases.

> Google is flailing. After years of singleminded worship of the false god Virtual Assistant, the company is rushing its AI strategy as its competitors join their hands and raise their pitchforks. The irony is it's all happening because Google thought it had the pitchfork market cornered. See, in 2017, Google researchers published the article 'Attention is all you need,' introducing the concept of the transformer and vastly improving the capabilities of machine learning models. You don't need to know the technical side of it (and indeed I am not the one to teach you), but it has been enormously influential and empowering; let it suffice to say that it's the T in GPT.

The former employee , who asked to remain anonymous to protect future job prospects, wasn't going to be the one to tell their old colleagues.

Experts say the shallow intensity of the two earthquakes was more than older buildings would be able to withstand.

Gale Crater was once Gale Lake, a brimming body of water that could have given rise to microbial life in the first billion years of Martian history, before the planet lost most of its atmosphere and water to space. If you want to find clues to exobiology, a place like Gale is where to start looking. Now, as NASA reports, Gale Crater is proving itself to be an even more fertile spelunking spot than once believed.

> When it comes to running Kubernetes in the cloud, one of the most significant costs can come from using a load balancer for each service. With prices starting at around $15 per month per load balancer, it's easy for costs to quickly add up, especially if you have a large number of pods. However, what if we told you that there's a way to run Kubernetes without the need for a load balancer and still get the benefits of high availability and automatic failover? In this article, we'll explore how you can achieve cost savings in the cloud by running Kubernetes without a load balancer.

Earlier this week, Apple was granted a patent (US-11571048-B1) for an Apple Watch strap release mechanism that could potentially be used with a built-in camera. That, on its own, is a neat idea, but it's also the third camera-related Apple Watch patent we've seen in recent years. The patent application was originally filed in 2019, so Apple engineers have clearly had wearable cameras on the brain for some time.

> Targeted policies and incentives do speed the uptake of electric vehicles. Credit: Shutterstock The ACT is changing how it calculates car registration fees . Instead of being based on a car's weight, the fee the owner pays will be based on the greenhouse gas emissions it produces. Up to now, owners of cleaner but typically heavier electric vehicles have paid more for registration than those of high-polluting but lighter vehicles powered by petrol or diesel engines. Emissions-based fees will reverse that situation.

As predicted based on a leaked and then modified support page, you can no longer use your parents' Netflix account if you don't live with them — unless they shell out extra cash every month ($7.

The phenomenon draws many parallels to presenteeism , which describes showing up for work to keep up appearances but getting very little done due to sickness or emotional challenges. Both concepts are born from workplace dissatisfaction and anxieties over job security, but unlike presenteeism, resenteeism describes a less guarded expression of similar frustrations. Resentful employees tend to be more active about their concerns, and put simply, are no longer afraid of hiding them.

From my understanding, the distance represents the square root of the difference of the error sum of squares of two clusters once they are merged minus the sum of the error sum of squares of each individual cluster.

Customers searching for inexpensive and mid-range choices might choose from a variety of Nord devices. Then came the T smartphones, followed by the R devices with the OnePlus 9 series, which were more affordable than the top flagship models.  Without a question, the company does its best to cram as much as it can into their devices to provide clients a fantastic experience.

To be honest, even on the weekend I can't play as much as I'd like, since adult life comes with other responsibilities and other things that, in the end, end up forcing you to leave those hobbies that you love a little more in the background.

> Even with all of the movie streaming services of today, I often have a hard time deciding on what to watch. A Good Movie To Watch is a site that lists highly rated yet little-known shows and movies. Browse by a curated list of the "best" films, or by category. I clicked on the "dark" mood category, and spotted some films I'd enjoyed a long time ago and would  love to rewatch such as Re-Animator (1985)  and Monster (2003) . Although you can't watch the movies directly from the site, I much prefer searching for ways to watch a specific option I have in mind than to waste time browsing the limited options on Netflix, only to give up and call off watching a movie all-together.

From overzealous marketing and worries about damaged battery longevity to handsets that simply charge too slowly, it seems like few brands actually get charging just right. Samsung is no different. Despite advertising 45W wired charging power since 2022's flagships, it turned out to be a brief peak rather than a sustainable power level last year. The result has been handsets that mostly have solid battery life but whose cells refill barely any faster than they did when charging at the older power levels.

[Still worth buying A12z iPad Pro in 2023](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/still-worth-buying-a12z-ipad-pro-in-2023.2380406/)


> I want to switch from an 11' ipad pro to a 12.9'. Is it worth getting a A12Z iPad Pro, or I should only consider an M1 model? My plan is to buy from Apple refurbished. I can sell my old ipad for £275 and A12Z model is £579. It looks like the M1 model is about to appear on Apple refurbished store at £849 so my cost to upgrade will be nearly double. For browsing, streaming and Facetime is it worth the extra cost? Personally, having both the non mini-LED and the mini-LED version, I don't care much about the difference in screen, but some people do and they go crazy about it.

> A significant deposit of lithium, a rare metal used in the manufacturing of batteries for electronic devices and electric vehicles, has been discovered in India. The deposit is estimated to be 5.9 million tonnes in the Salal-Haimana area of Reasi District of Jammu & Kashmir (UT), making it one of the largest deposits of lithium in the world. "The unavailability of Lithium has been one of the reasons why India has been dependent on other countries for Li-Ion batteries and other EV components. Lithium being one of the core elements of the Li-Ion batteries and taking into consideration the financial impact of sourcing Lithium, the recent discovery of Lithium reserves in J&K does come in as a new lease of life as it further enables India's ambition to become self-sufficient in its energy storage needs,' Pankaj Sharma, Co-Founder and Director of Log9 Materials said.

These two things are still related. That's because heat will still need temperature to be able to have an effect on other objects around it. Meanwhile, on the other hand, the effect of temperature on objects is also the cause of the occurrence of heat on objects. That's why, the two are inseparable. So, if you are still confused, here are some things you should understand about the meaning of the two.

The reason people are concerned about stock levels is that the gas from Russia has disappeared from the market. Nor does it have the infrastructure or the capacity to extract and transport all the gas Europe needs at the moment.

Its e-ink display also keeps the device's battery life up to Fossil's impressive standards. However, while the hybrid watch may be a class act, it's not the perfect companion for a gym class. In short, the watch lands in an unfortunate limbo between a timepiece and a health tool, without necessarily nailing either one.

Reading his interview with David Remnick in the New Yorker last week, the first he has given since he was attacked on stage last August – stabbed 15 times in the face and neck and chest and hands – was to be reminded of some of the darker ironies of his existence.

Even for this company, though, there's nothing to touch the prophetic influence and punk-rock abandon of one of Nintendo's most daring designs ever: WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!

The smartphone line, which was unveiled at the company's February Unpacked event in San Francisco alongside the Galaxy Book 3, consists of three models: the Galaxy S23, Galaxy S23 Plus and the top-specced Galaxy S23 Ultra. But, what's the difference between each model? Starting prices for the phones, at least in the US, remain the same as last year, with the base Galaxy S23 starting at $800 (£849, AU$1,349), bumping up to $1,000 (£1,049, AU$1,649) for the Galaxy S23 Plus and maxing out at $1,200 (£1,249, AU$1,949) for the Galaxy 23 Ultra.

> The BSD license is preferable for transferring research results in a way that will widely be deployed and most benefit an economy. As such, research funding agencies, such as the NSF, ONR and DARPA, should encourage in the earliest phases of funded research projects, the adoption of BSD style licenses for software, data, results, and open hardware. They should also encourage formation of standards based around implemented Open Source systems and ongoing Open Source projects. Government policy should minimize the costs and difficulties in moving from research to deployment.

> Apple's wireless platform for audio and video streaming — AirPlay — is one of the best ways to play music from an Apple device to a wireless speaker. When at home, on a Wi-Fi network, it outperforms Bluetooth thanks to its wider bandwidth. The conventional wisdom has always been that AirPlay sets a hard limit on audio quality: iPhones and other Apple devices can only transmit lossless CD-quality audio, at 16-bit/44.1kHz, to an AirPlay-enabled speaker, leaving the technology incapable of supporting the higher-res streams now being offered by Apple Music and others.

Obviously it won't charge as fast but will it charge to full say like the old 16 inch MBP's before the new fast charging capability (like 2.5 to 3 hours). Reason I ask is I have a Belkin 97W charging dock and wondered if it would still charge a 16 inch M2Max.

But at least for the time being, artificial intelligence (AI) will not be able to compete with human intelligence. But it already poses a danger to conventional technologies, which in a sense are what gave rise to AI over the previous few decades. In recent weeks, there has been a flurry of activity and excitement in the tech community about how AI finally seems to have arrived at the tipping point where it is beginning to affect everything it comes into contact with.

That surprise is the release of the Game Boy Color version of Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare . The game was among the crop of Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance titles announced for the Nintendo Switch Online and Online Expansion Pack service.

It kind of blows my mind given the amount of Python comments I've seen of the form # [B, Z-1, Log(Q), 45] -> [B, Z, 1024] or something like that.

> Power consumption when idling is lower than on the Precision 7670 by several watts likely because of the more demanding OLED panel on the latter. When running higher loads like Witcher 3, however, consumption would become noticeably higher on the Lenovo than on the Dell (208 W vs. 159 W). The higher power draw coincides with the faster CPU and GPU performance over the competing Dell model as shown through our benchmarks above. Though power users may appreciate the extra performance, our fully loaded Lenovo is significantly more demanding than most other mobile workstations.

But while this overlap theoretically offers considerable benefits, such as the ability to use your own USB controller rather than being stuck with the system's default, the manufacturers haven't always been so accommodating. Take for example the removable hard drive of the Xbox 360.

And LeBron James had just received a fresh batch of teammates following a flurry of activity from the Cleveland Cavaliers prior to the trade deadline. A 121-99 thumping of the Boston Celtics at TD Garden in the team's first game following the addition of Jordan Clarkson , Rodney Hood , George Hill and Larry Nance Jr . prompted James to exclaim afterward , 'We've got a f—ing squad now!' Five years later, he didn't quite go that far after a 109-103 road win by the new-look Los Angeles Lakers over the Golden State Warriors — but James, who did not play in the game due to an ankle injury but was on the sideline cheering on his new teammates, was certainly impressed.

This, of course, means that it has once again been time to name The Hero of Time. For many, there is an obvious answer to this one: Link. That is the name of the series' lead protagonist, so that is the name that many a dedicated Hylian explorer opts for (bar the odd save file all in lowercase or, in some instances, a file where everyone appears to shout the hero's name as he goes by, "LINK").

> Home » Celebrities » Tom Cruise to shut down his UK production after being invited to the Chubbly It's still so fascinating to watch Tom Cruise cozy up to the British establishment and British royal family. Cruise has been based out of England for years now, as he's worked on back-to-back productions filming at Shepperton. He seems to enjoy British life a lot – I have no idea if he has a place in London, but I'm sure he's bought (or he rents) a place in the country. He was invited to some of the Jubbly events last year, and he hosted a royal premiere for Top Gun: Maverick , personally escorting Prince William and Kate around.

> The Midnight Parasites is a short psychedelic animation directed by Yoji Kuri. This wonderfully strange 9-minute film, created in 1972, has been regarded as a precursor to René Laloux's acclaimed 1973 animation, Fantastic Planet . The Midnight Parasites takes place in a desolate, alien landscape where many strange beings interact. Some of the creatures are kind and others are destructive. Watching it feels like peeking into Kuri's mind and watching a beautiful and scary fever dream. The originality and raw creativity in this animation is awe-inspiring.

A source claims that Apple will only include a 120 Hz refresh rate in the iPhone 15 Pro models, meaning that the basic variants of the iPhone 15 in 2023 will also be left out in the cold. Although mid-range Android handsets have had 90 Hz to 120 Hz displays for years, Apple has always priced them more than they should be for the iPhone. And if a leaker's story is accurate, Apple may once again cheat the majority of its customers out of iPhones.

[Iatrogenics: Why Intervention Often Leads to Worse Outcomes](https://fs.blog/iatrogenics/)


> Iatrogenics is when a treatment causes more harm than benefit. As iatros means healer in Greek, the word means 'caused by the healer' or 'brought by the healer.'  Healer, in this sense, need not mean doctor, but anyone intervening to solve a problem. For example, it could be a thought leader, a CEO, a government, or a coalition of the willing. Nassim Taleb calls these people interventionistas. Often these people come armed with solutions to solve the first-order consequences of a decision but create worse second and subsequent order consequences.

> Jason Derulo found himself trending on Twitter Sunday afternoon for his pregame ‘TikTok Tailgate' — but for his terrifying squad of backup dancers, not his singing. Derulo was joined on stage by a pack of robot dogs, as made famous by Boston Dynamics' demonstration videos of their robotic canines being a little too nimble for human comfort — and then even more infamous by a fourth season episode of the Netflix series Black Mirror , in which the robot dogs are literally predators hunting down humans.

> For those of us who don't follow football, the Super Bowl can be an annual exercise in frustration. The best sports let us find freedom, power, and capacity in our identification with talented athletes, but this outsized spectacle inevitably leaves the untutored feeling helpless. Watching, you're all but imprisoned by the erratic stop-and-start rhythms of the game, trapped by its baroque rules. If, as the NFL slogan has it, 'Football is family,' then the Super Bowl is our near-obligatory reminder that hanging out with your family is almost always terrible.

> Announced just over a year ago, it seems development on Alan Wake 2 is moving along at a nice pace. In a recent earnings report, the game's developer Remedy announced that the game is now 'playable from start to finish,' meaning that (for the most part) it's feature-complete and now waiting for all of the assets and content to be put into place before it goes into a polishing phase. It bodes well for the projected 2023 release but obviously things could easily change over the coming months. In its report, Remedy also revealed that while the remaster of the original Alan Wake has not yet generated any royalties for the company it expects sales to pick up closer to the launch of the sequel as players get acquainted or re-acquainted with the story.

> Set in the 1890s, Hogwarts Legacy places players in a never-before-seen version of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and allows them to explore to their heart's content. While exploring the vast wizarding world, it is possible to stumble upon a variety of interesting items, but some are harder to find than others. While the Moonstones available in Hogwarts Legacy aren't exactly hard to find, collecting the amount players need will likely take them a great deal of time and effort. Thankfully, there is a way to get a lot of them if the player is willing to bide their time.

> I don't know about you, but I miss role-playing games. Not that they caress the soul of oldfags who recognize the world only in an isometric perspective – everything seems to be in order with them, there is a relatively quick release Baldur's Gate 3 looms, and last year King Arthur: Knight's Tale pleased fans of the genre, and even the domestic game dev is not far behind, presenting to the public Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. I'm talking about the games of the seventh generation of consoles, when RPGs were more often told about the adventures of a lone hero (well, or a hero accompanied by a couple of secondary characters), they gave plenty of sight of the world around thanks to the camera from the first or third person and relied on the action component when interacting with the outside world rather than rolling imaginary dice when calculating probabilities.

> Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is facing an unexpected challenge that the franchise has not dealt with in almost two decades, with the title having to provide content for two years due to there being no mainline release planned for the IP in 2023. With the title already facing criticisms for the alleged lack of content that the base game possesses, it is clear to see how difficult it might be for the title to keep fans truly engaged over the coming year. With this in mind, it has recently been rumored that 2023 will see a dedicated expansion be released for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 , with many assuming that the confirmed "full premium release" that the franchise will receive this year refers to this DLC.

James Watt gets primary credit for the widespread of this unit of measurement. We honor him today by using his name to express engine power unequivocally – in kilowatts. But the humble horsepower is the informal – and very much used – means of discriminating between piston yield.

Riot has made the champion unavailable to play due to a series of 'in-game issues,' according to an announcement made via the League client.  Players who log into League and attempt to pick Aurelion Sol in a ranked (or normal) game will be unable to do so until the gameplay issues surrounding the champion are resolved. While it's unclear at this time exactly why Aurelion Sol is disabled—Riot has not provided players with any official reasoning—it's likely that the champion is unavailable to play due to a serious game-breaking bug.

Perhaps too much work, but perhaps it could be automated if predictions are coded in some way.

> Authored by Mark Jeftovic via BombThrower.com, Ruminating over our robot overlords and the missing scenario Now that  ChatGPT  has exploded onto the stage, there is renewed hype around Artificial Intelligence (AI). Whenever AI captures the public imagination, we are subjected to unrestrained conjectures around how it will inevitably take over the future and change our lives. We're led to believe that AI will usher an era of hyper-intelligent overlords, so far advanced beyond our own coarse and analog cognitive skills that the existential question of the future will center around: how much power or rights do we confer on these beings? will they act benevolently or malevolently toward us? ​ But these questions presuppose a core assumption around AI that everybody agrees isn't true now but will inevitably become true in the future – after a few more iterations of Moore's Law… That's the idea that AI will achieve  general  artificial intelligence, and with that is implied some degree  sentience  (otherwise there is nothing to give any rights  to ).

> The kidney is an organ that functions as a body filter, which removes waste and harmful substances that have the potential to pass through it. The waste normally filtered by the kidneys is called urea. When the kidneys are not working properly, waste can back up into the bloodstream and cause it to build up there. This buildup of wastes in the blood causes uremia. Uremia means urine in the blood, and it refers to the accumulated effect of waste products in the bloodstream.

These US-based scientists wrote that the 'large amounts of dust' between Earth and the sun could 'limit the amount of sunlight received' by the planet. The idea is to create something like a barrier that allows part of the radiation to be blocked to mitigate climate change, and the researchers simulated a number of scenarios, including the scattering of dust particles from a space platform located at one of the Lagrangian points, where the gravitational forces balance between the Earth and the sun.

With this innovative method, the doctors hope to enable more rapid interventions, helping keep people well for longer and easing financial pressures on the NHS.

These particular picks, despite being non-meta weaponry, can act as very effective sniper-support platforms in the hands of skilled players.

[Finally, WhatsApp Web will allow us to send photos without losing quality from the computer](https://www.world-today-news.com/finally-whatsapp-web-will-allow-us-to-send-photos-without-losing-quality-from-the-computer/)


> One of the easiest ways to send photos from one device to another is to do it through WhatsApp. However, until now these photographs could not be sent at full resolution. Neither in the mobile version nor in WhatsApp Web and WhatsApp Desktop. Taking into account that half a year ago the file limit was increased to 2 GB, leaving behind 100 MB, it was to be expected that soon they could be sent without losing an iota of quality. and while the beta of WhatsApp for mobiles already showed this path It seems that WhatsApp Web is also on the way to incorporating this function.

> Mohammed Al-Moneer, Sr. Regional Director, META, Infoblox says decentralised working requires thorough, secure DNS management. Where is your data stored? Where is the software located? You used to be able to answer these questions by pointing to the cabinet where your server was located. Today it is more difficult. Is it on your own server(s)? In the cloud? Both, everywhere and nowhere? Without Domain Name System (DNS) you have no idea. In a world in which organisations increasingly work decentralised, it becomes all the more important that you arrive at the right destinations.

[Wild Hearts is a more sensitive stab at Monster Hunter](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/wild-hearts-preview-pre-launch/)


> The Koei Tecmo-developed and EA-published monster hunting game Wild Hearts , in which players hunt giant beasts called Kemono with the help of a magical piece of crafting technology called a Karakuri, left an impression on me when I played through its opening hours late last year. Now that I've had time to go hands-on with the final version of the game, I'm even more impressed with its philosophical approach to hunting and the impact it leaves on the environment. Rather than just serving as a hunting simulator or glorifying abuse toward animals, Wild Hearts highlights the balance between nature and life.

Here we will look at the use of cyber in the years leading to the kinetic war, and the use of cyber technology on the modern kinetic battlefield. We need to understand the meaning of cyber and the meaning of war, to question whether the two concepts can be separated, and to ask ourselves if we are ever not at war.

[Wipe MacBook Pro 13" (2017) without the admin credentials](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wipe-macbook-pro-13-2017-without-the-admin-credentials.2380644/)


> I have a MacBook Pro 13" A1708 that's from my previous employer. When I was upgrading in 2020 they said I could keep the older machine because they upgraded and were not using the A1708's anymore. I threw it in a drawer and forgot about it. My dinosaur 2011 model just died so I grabbed the 13" and I can log on with my old login name and password, but it's still all locked up with the admin credentials, so I can't change preferences, wipe it, or anything. I did not leave on good terms with the company and due to my disability discrimination lawsuit with them, I cannot reach out to ask them to wipe it for me.

> The M2 Pro version of the Mac mini offers extra performance grunt to the compact Mac, in a package that hits the sweet spot, and threatens its larger stablemate, the Mac Studio. The Mac mini has always been an effective entry-level option for upgraders and switchers who already have a keyboard, mouse, and display, but just need the brains of the operation. There has always been a narrow computing power range in that small block, but until now, it never spanned that much of the performance spectrum.

This affects not only the increased battery capacity, but also the new chipset and the overall device settings. But there is one annoying catch… On the one hand, Samsung, like other companies in the industry, seems to be running out of breath and innovating only in small steps or not at all. Taking a cursory look at the S23 family, you would be hard-pressed to find a reason to switch from last year's generation, even much older devices can serve less demanding users well thanks to long support and quality workmanship.

> In order to measure blood pressure with wearable devices, Fitbit recently applied for a patent for a force-sensitive display. However, as it is just a patent it is not guaranteed that this feature will make it to production on either a Fitbit or Pixel smart watch. The patent was spotted by The Verge  and shows a design that takes inspiration from the standard blood pressure cuff. This differs from the mechanism most watches currently sold in the U.S. that measure blood pressure have. Instead of using a PPG sensor to accurately gauge blood pressure when worn, this design suggests that blood pressure would be measured similarly to how a normal blood pressure measuring cuff would.

[Apple's Crash Detection goes through another round of 'optimizations'](https://mobilesyrup.com/2023/02/13/apples-crash-detection-goes-through-another-round-of-optimizations/)


> Apple's Crash Detection feature is a genuinely useful tool that also has several drawbacks. Reports regarding false crash signals with the feature aren't entirely new. Following the feature falsely detecting crashes when the wearer is riding a roller coaster, it was discovered that Crash Detection also sometimes gives false positives when the user participates in winter sports like skiing. Apple's iOS 16.1.2 update included 'Crash Detection optimizations,' though it seems the update wasn't enough to deter false positives, and the Cupertino-based giant is now trying to optimize the feature again.

The government has committed the country to decarbonization targets that require significant cuts to transport-related emissions. But decarbonizing long-distance travel is not part of the plan—the national rail operator KiwiRail remains focused on freight. We argue the revival of long-distance passenger rail needs to be part Aotearoa's strategy to bring emissions down.

[Unlocking the Potential of Kubectl Shortcuts with PowerShell](https://medium.com/@aabeing/unlocking-the-potential-of-kubectl-shortcuts-with-powershell-9ae4d15ea79b)


> Kubectl is the command-line interface that connects us to the heart of Kubernetes: the API server. With kubectl, we can create, update, and delete resources in the cluster, manage pods and services, and even troubleshoot issues. It's the command-line companion that makes the magic of Kubernetes accessible to us. But, even the most experienced Kubernetes administrator can find themselves stuck in a tedious cycle of typing the same commands repeatedly. But what if you could break free from this monotony and elevate your kubectl game to a whole new level? This is where the power of kubectl shortcuts comes in, allowing us to streamline our workflow and unlock the full potential of our clusters.

> A new study finds that only 8 per cent of AI professionals depicted in film are women– a dismal statistic that researchers worry is exacerbating existing gender inequality in the tech industry. Researchers at the University of Cambridge analysed 142 of the most influential films featuring AI from 1920 to 2020. Out of the 116 individuals playing AI researchers, only nine of them were women (8 per cent) and none of the films were solely directed by a woman.  Some of the reasons for this poor female representation on screen are theorised to be the lack of female directors, the influence of gendered narrative tropes and parallels between film and real-life gender inequality.

The Corsair HS65 from this review belongs to the latter caste. Their purpose is to offer comfort during long-term wear and quality sound not only for games. Did they achieve their goal? I like simple things. I have a long familiarity with the 3.5mm jack, it has always worked and until now I am missing it on my phone. I have it on my computer too, so why avoid it? Perhaps because you have Bluetooth on your laptop and you don't want to connect extra cables.

> Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a novel technique introduced by Microsoft in 2021 for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). LoRA is an efficient adaptation strategy that introduces no additional inference latency and substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks while maintaining model quality. Although LoRA was initially proposed for LLMs, it also can be applied elsewhere. Inspired by the Stable Diffusion paper published in 2022 by the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Heidelberg University and Runway ML, independent researchers such as Simo Ryu ( @cloneofsimo ) came up with the idea of applying LoRA to Stable Diffusion, posting multiple examples and insights on their GitHub project page .

[Is Xiaomi's shine dimming in India?](http://www.businessghana.com/site/news/Technology/279856/Is-Xiaomi%E2%80%99s-shine-dimming-in-India)


> Xiaomi — the company that originally made its name as 'the Apple of China' — broke out of its home market and became a household name in India shortly after its debut in 2014. Its initial, rapid success was with phones, but that gave Chinese company the velocity to take on other product categories, where it became a big player in wearables, smart TVs and IoT devices. Within two years, it was even investing in Indian startups and making a move into consumer lending services. But now, as Beijing-based Xiaomi approaches its ninth year in the country with 200 million smartphones shipped, its earlier mover advantages are eroding: it lost its top position in smartphone shipments in Q4 2022; it faces regulatory pressure in the country amid growing economic tensions between China and India; and it's wound down some of its newer business ventures.

Police forces have reportedly been warned by Home Secretary Suella Braverman that they might be leaving themselves vulnerable to Beijing interference by using Chinese technology.

> In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria, thousands of volunteer software developers have been using a crucial Twitter tool to comb the platform for calls for help — including from people trapped in collapsed buildings — and connect people with rescue organizations. They could lose access as soon as Monday unless they pay Twitter a monthly fee of at least $100 — prohibitive for many volunteers and nonprofits on shoestring budgets. 'That's not just for rescue efforts which unfortunately we're coming to the end of, but for logistics planning too as people go to Twitter to broadcast their needs,' said Sedat Kapanoglu, the founder of Eksi Sozluk, Turkey's most popular social platform, who has been advising some of the volunteers in their efforts.

> Human Resources (HR) plays a vital role in expanding firms. HR processes are responsible for attracting and maintaining top talent, taking care of team member compensation and benefits, and ensuring adherence to labor laws.  As companies grow, the HR team's responsibilities become more complex and time-consuming, putting more pressure on the department to streamline these processes. Efficient HR practices save time, lower costs, and boost team member satisfaction. Streamlined HR processes also guarantee compliance with labor laws, minimizing the risk of legal issues and penalties.

'Australia should come first, I don't think there's particularly much debate about that including by gas producers themselves,' Mr Kavonic told Sky News host Andrew Bolt. 'I think the real question first of all is, can Australians come first for gas if you've put the entire gas industry in terminal decline and then there's no gas available for anyone? 'Secondly – is it really necessary to tear up the rules of the entire gas market and break contracts? There are actually much more nuanced and finessed ways to address this, to get the outcome we want which is more gas available domestically.

So relying exclusively on Democrats for continued climate progress would be a strategic blunder. Bipartisanship is the only assured path to decarbonizing at scale and speed. Despite this reality, the climate movement has done far too little to lay the groundwork for bipartisan action. For years, philanthropists have poured money into progressive climate groups, while largely overlooking opportunities to engage right-of-center communities on this topic.

But in a 2007 lawsuit between the two brands, Colgate-Palmolive lost on the grounds that the two brands were "similar" but not "substantially indistinguishable." Determining trademark infringement can often be challenging and fraught with controversy. The reason is that, at its core, a verdict for infringement requires proof that the two brands are confusingly similar. And yet the existing approach primarily relies on self-report, which is known to be vulnerable to biases and manipulation.

That's why I was instantly on-board with Blanc when it was revealed. A completely black-and-white game that features a wolf cub and fawn? I knew then and there that I'd be checking this game out as soon as the opportunity presented itself. It's very important to say that while I definitely have elements of any form of entertainment I like, they don't automatically give that piece of entertainment a pass.

Be it novel attack paths, lethal adversaries, new technologies — such as public cloud, containerization, Kubernetes , and serverless computing — or stringent regulatory requirements, teams have faced quite the burden. To help shoulder the load, the industry has established frameworks and pushed out amazing tech, from SIEMs to CNAPPs and XDRs to CASBs. These processes and technologies have helped to keep attackers at bay and people protected, but have created a new problem of far too much data.

One of the biggest culprit of the MP 6,1 from what i've seen on many review videos and discussions are the only proprietary GPU options. But wouldn't it be possible to design a PCB which has the exact same shape as a D300 with screw holes in the exact same places to mount the card and on that card there would be an MXM connector to slot in any GPU? I know it's easier said than done but once all precise measurements are done, screw holes in the exact spot, power posts and the big connector to interface GPU daughter card, the project could be sent to a company like PCBway or any other.

> A new report from the Financial Times claims 50% of all iPhone casings made in India at the moment are rejected by Apple quality control. The report is based on information from former Apple employees and specifies the low yield issue in Indian manufacturing giant Tata's plant located in Hosur. No other manufacturing plants were mentioned in the report. The new report claims that the low iPhone casing yield in India is a big hit on Apple's plans to outsource a larger chunk of iPhone manufacturing in India.

But it also wants you to think it's cool — kind of like a dad who doesn't know how to relate to you now that you're both adults who can recognize that he's always sorta only had maybe one or two good bits. Quantumania knows those bits have worked in the past , and it gamely whips them out as part of the Ant-Man series' most visually imaginative stories yet. But rather than coasting on its sense of dad-focused humor , Quantumania tries to switch things up a bit by mainlining a few doses of whatever psychedelics Doctor Strange has been brewing and inviting you to partake in a little madness that doesn't always make sense .

> Jakarta – The icy volcanism of Pluto's massive moon Charon and its belts of surface rifts may have been caused by frozen subsurface oceans exploding through thin ice shells. Recent modeling suggests that when Charon's internal ocean freezes, it may form a deep, elongated depression along its center, but this may imply that its outer shell was thinner than currently thought at some point in the moon's history. The models also show that a cryovolcano erupting with ice, water and other material is less likely to occur in Charon's northern hemisphere.

[[재팬 톡] Can Samsung Stop Apple?](https://www.world-today-news.com/%ec%9e%ac%ed%8c%ac-%ed%86%a1-can-samsung-stop-apple/)


> I used to use Samsung ‘Galaxy' and switched to Apple's ‘iPhone' 3 years ago. At the time, as a reporter for Samsung, I had the mindset that our company should do well, and I also had the mindset that I could write a good article only if I tried a competitor's product once. But now, the reporter can't deny ‘Appleungi' (Apple's loyal customer as a compound word of Apple and Gopdeungi). Apple products that started with the iPhone have expanded to ‘AirPod', ‘Apple Watch', and ‘iPad'. When I bought an iPad that I didn't really need, I thought about it for several months to find out why I needed it, and eventually pressed the purchase button without finding a place to use it.

For neuroscientists, that quality of otherness is more than a curiosity. Many mysteries remain about the origins of hallucinations, but one hypothesis suggests that when people hear voices, they are hearing their own thoughts disguised as another person's by a quirk of the brain. Scientists would like to understand what parts of the brain allow us to recognize ourselves speaking, but studying this using recordings of people's own voices has proved tricky.

Rather, it's kind of the same thing as acceleration -- a force we're very used to thinking about on the regular. He called it the equivalence principle, and soon, this eye-opening concept would blossom into the mind-bending theory of general relativity. The rest, as they say, is history.

There's something silly about the exaggeration; eternal torture and constant agony are difficult to imagine because they're so extreme. By contrast, waiting in line eternally only to be told you've filled in the wrong form when you arrive at the desk is a nightmare I can get behind. That's the premise behind  Red Tape , a new bureaucracy sim-style narrative adventure from Pollaris Studios and horror mainstays DreadXP. On paper (and there's a lot of paper in Hell), Red Tape  is an enticing prospect.

That has involved  a sleazy smear campaign , seeded in the press by non-profits linked to companies like News Corporation, AT&T, and Comcast, falsely accusing Sohn of being a radical extremist who hates  Hispanics ,  rural Americans ,  cops , puppies, and freedom. With Sohn  freshly re-nominated  by the Biden administration, the attacks recently began anew, with industry seeding homophobic attacks in friendly press outlets, and News Corporation, one of several companies behind the attacks, feebly trying to falsely frame Sohn (genuinely popular across both sides of the aisle) as an unhinged radical in its opinion section .

[Power, Solar cells](https://www.world-today-news.com/power-solar-cells-how-high-must-the-electricity-price-be-for-solar-cells-to-pay-off/)


> The power crisis has given a solid boost in the installation of solar panels. In 2022, 7,691 new solar systems came online in Norway, which is more than threefold from the previous year. – Otovo doubled the number of installations in the first three quarters of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase is unprecedented. Taken together with the fact that demand tripled, this means that waiting times also increased sharply in the past year. However, this is improving because the equipment manufacturers have adapted their production and there has been more capacity on the installer side, Otovo manager Silje Gjeraker tells Nettavisen.

[Apple Watch Crash Detection helped response team locate car accident in Germany](https://mobilesyrup.com/2023/02/14/apple-watch-crash-detection-helped-response-team-locate-car-accident-in-germany/)


> Apple's Crash Detection feature is notorious for pushing out false negatives. Over the past few months, there have been several reports of the feature triggering emergency calls when the wearer of an Apple Watch or someone with an iPhone 14 series device is engaging in winter sports, or riding on a roller coaster. Amid the false positives, there have been several cases where the feature has actually assisted in locating someone in dire need of help. News coming out of Germany via Mittelbayerische Zeitung suggests that the Crash Detection was responsible for helping three people that were in a car crash where their vehicle fell down a deep embankment.

> A father and child were playing by a creek in Wyoming County, Pennsylvania when their ball rolled into the water. After climbing down to retrieve it they spotted a black plastic bag. Inside the bag, they found what appeared to be human remains. Turns out, it wasn't that. But the reality is still pretty darn creepy. From PA Homepage : At the scene, police say a black plastic bag with an "extremely lifelike" human foot sticking out of it was discovered. The foot was said to be highly detailed, complete with a French manicure.

> You probably remember the classic Super Smash Bros. commercial in which Mario, Donkey Kong, and others duke it out in full costume. But did you know that those same costumes were used in a promotional event called Slamfest ‘99, in which actors actually fought in a ring, complete with a crowd and referee? If you didn't, you'd be forgiven, because the event has become lost in obscurity over time. Originally taking place in Las Vegas, it was actually livestreamed at the time, but almost no video or photographic record of the event exists today.

> Since the advent of chats and instant messaging, emojis have been an integral part of modern communication. They are used to express feelings, convey sensations, communicate information or even to make jokes. The craze created around these small symbols has led to the creation of new emoticons. Today a wide choice of emojis is offered to users of messaging applications. The meaning of some of them is obvious, but for others the interpretation can be many and varied. Let's take the example of the heart emoji with a dot below on WhatsApp.

> Third-party cookie deprecation in Chrome has been delayed so many times it's become a punchline. But progress in the Android Privacy Sandbox is proceeding apace. On Tuesday, Google announced the first beta release of Android Privacy Sandbox, which will roll out to a small percentage of Android 13 devices to start, then expand to more devices over time. Google didn't share a specific timeframe, but the beta release itself is happening on time. Google told developers in late 2022 to expect the beta to kick off early this year.

[Call of Duty Warzone 2: Season 2 Release Time and Updates](https://www.denofgeek.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-2-season-2-release-time-and-updates/)


> To keep players on their toes, Season 2 will also feature new maps, contracts, and events. For instance, once per match, players killed on Ashika will drop dog tags. If a teammate or the revived player picks it up, they will receive a small influx of cash and UAV ping. Of course, this is easier said than done because depending on how a match goes, returning to the scene of your death might be more trouble than it's worth and a surefire way to die again. Players looking for something outside of Ashika will also be able to join several new game modes.

[The Great Laptop / Backing Tracks Debate: Whose Side Are You On?](https://loudwire.com/laptop-backing-tracks-debate-big-deal/)


> One of the hottest and most controversial topics sparking debate on social media recently is whether or not real rock bands use laptops or backing tracks to enhance their live performances — and whether that should be considered cheating. Although it's not a new subject by any means, it caused a stir of conversation when Falling In Reverse had to cancel a festival gig because their laptops, which included some harmony vocals, had  gone missing . Some rock purists only see this in black and white and are quick to proclaim that real rock artists don't use tracks at all — but, I beg to differ.

[15吋MacBook Air重磅上膛 蘋果直攻Wintel大本營](https://www.digitimes.com.tw/tech/dt/n/shwnws.asp?cnlid=1)


> 蘋果傳將推15吋MacBook Air，搶攻Wintel長期盤踞大本營。符世旻攝 蘋果（Apple）MacBook供應鏈陸續接到客戶下修出貨訊息，然業界評估，隨著第2季新款15吋MacBook Air上市，有望帶來新動能。 此外，蘋果下半年3奈米MacBook蓄勢待發，可望讓蘋果在下半年NB復甦潮中，動能優於同業。 蘋果MacBook Air為輕薄機種代表，曾經掀起輕薄Ultrabook熱潮，其經典外型在2022年才明顯改變，搭上蘋果自研的M2處理器，掀起一波銷售熱潮，如今蘋果要推出15吋MacBook Air，亦為新突破，因為從2008年起，蘋果MacBook只有2種尺寸，一為11吋，二為13吋。 蘋果MacBook Air最早於2008年在創辦人Steve Jobs從牛皮紙袋拿出來，驚豔全球果迷後，就一直保有13吋螢幕尺寸機種，從2010年到2015年期間，曾往下出到11吋MacBook Air，在2018年以後，又回歸13吋單一螢幕大小，如今跨到15吋，預估將再度掀起市場熱議。 業界傳出，15吋的MacBook Air供應鏈已經陸續在農曆年後開始進入量產，從時間預估，發表時間將會在第2季，由於15吋為歐美消費者最常使用的NB螢幕尺寸。DIGITIMES Research統計，2023年第1季台廠出貨的NB機種，15吋佔比達33%最高，其次為14吋的31.

[BMW M3 Touring Wagon Still Listed for $80K Even After Being Wrecked](https://www.thedrive.com/news/bmw-m3-touring-wagon-still-listed-for-80k-even-after-being-wrecked)


> The 2023 BMW M3 Touring may only exist in Europe , but it's still the first wagon ever to be graced with a full-fledged M badge. For that reason alone it's just awesome. But awesome enough to justify an $80,000 price tag even after being wrecked, however? One Swiss owner certainly thinks so, even after having smashed the wagon's front end to smitherines. The M3 Competition Touring is listed for sale online for 72,999 Swiss Francs, or $79,210 as of writing. It has clearly been involved in a serious front-end collision, which is definitely going to require a ton of work to repair.

[Love Doesn't Suck in Romancelvania, the Metroidvania Dating-Sim](https://cogconnected.com/2023/02/romancelvania-metroidvania-dating-sim/)


> Video games are unique. One of the reasons is that there are opportunities for players to love undead creatures, normally a crime in most states. In a unholy mix of Metroidvania, dating-sim, and parody, we get the surprisingly charming Romancelvania. For the past couple of years, The Deep End Games has been working on this title after getting it kickstarted. You play as Drac, a contestant on a reality dating show called Love at First Bite. Other contestants and potential monster mashers include a genie, succubus, gorgon, and werewolf, among others.

However, evidence has piled up which points to the new model most likely being the real deal.

In Europe, the depreciation between the previous year's levels and 2021's was approximately 5%, as the region suffered a direct result of the war in Ukraine and ongoing disruptions to the supply chain. As expected with the decline in air cargo traffic, several airports across the European region suffered severe contractions in their freight volumes, although a small handful, somewhat unexpectedly, saw significant improvements.

As the company explains it, the ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 3D OLED uses a 3D lenticular lens layered on top of the display. This allows it to beam light from the display into directions beyond dead ahead. This is the tech that is used to essentially beam two different images to each eye of the user, creating its 3D image.

> Pioneering writer and artist Osamu Tezuka, often called 'the godfather of manga,' is widely credited with helping give Japanese comics and animation their distinctive look and visual language. But he inspired generations of creators in highly specific ways as well as general industry-wide ones. The manga series Pluto , serialized from 2003 to 2009, is one example — based on a story arc from Tezuka's signature Astro Boy manga series, Pluto was an award-winner and bestseller, a series that re-imagined Tezuka's mid-1960s 'Greatest Robot on Earth' story arc for a new generation, as a cyber-noir story about a future detective chasing down a string of murders that might have been committed by a robot.

But BSNL is soon expected to launch 4G, if not 5G. The telco is still working out the finer details of the testing with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), but once that is done, BSNL will start a phase-wise rollout of 5G in the country.

But most large, deeply technical companies like ours, have been working on these very large, generative AI models themselves for a long time." Jassy also pointed out that the company is also pursuing opportunities to partner with smaller firms to develop this area of the business.

> A few days ago we talked about the Chinese GPU MTT S80 from the company Moore Threads. We know about it, for example, that it has a frequency of 1.8 GHz and 4096 MUSA stream processors, which gives a gross performance of 14.4 TFLOPS in FP32. The 16GB memory on the 256-bit bus is also solid, and the use of the PCIe Gen5 x16 bus is also unique. We have 3 DisplayPort 1.4 ports and one HDMI 2.1. Although it has 27% lower raw performance than the Intel A770, it was 35-61% slower in earlier tests. Another test we'll talk about today, however, shows even worse results and shows that there's still a lot of catching up to do (and also raises questions about a possible error in the test).

And indeed, they were: the derailed trains began leaking dangerous chemicals, including the carcinogenic vinyl chloride , which lead the company to decide that the best course of action was to burn the chemicals and turn them into a horrifyingly massive smoke plume over the 5,000-person town.

APT37, also tracked under the monikers Reaper, RedEyes, Ricochet Chollima, and ScarCruft, is linked to North Korea's Ministry of State Security (MSS) unlike the Lazarus and Kimsuky threat clusters that are part of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).

DOI: 10.1016/j.enbuild.2022.112717 Office buildings are typically not energy efficient, and globally they contribute to nearly a third of greenhouse gas emissions from construction to end of life. A new study out of the University of Waterloo analyzes data-driven improvements in Canada's first zero-carbon, net-positive energy building showing how they play a vital role in that building generating more energy than it consumes. In the first case study of its kind in Canada, researchers found that the net-positive building used more energy than originally predicted during the first nine months of operation while the operators were still learning about building systems.

> If staying healthy burned a hole in your pocket last year, you may be able to get some of that money back. Deductions are one-off adjustments to your taxable income. When you document them on your tax return, they lower your overall tax burden. Most Americans elect to take the standard deduction, which reduces taxable income by $12,950 for single filers, $19,400 for heads of household and $25,900 for joint filers for the 2022 tax year. However, if you have unique one-time expenses, such as a large medical bill, waiving the standard deduction and itemizing your expenses instead may lead to a bigger refund.

However, our research published today suggests rising costs of living are more likely to increase household energy use as people economize by doing more at home. Our research shows people relate to energy through what it helps them do: feed the family, clean the house and stay healthy, comfortable and entertained.

> NEW YORK, New York - Technology stocks advanced on U.S. stock markets Wednesday, however, the industrials were limited to minor gains. "The labor market's resilience is the main reason consumers continue to spend and as long as that's the case, inflation is likely to remain sticky," Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance said in a note to clients on Wednesday. "The Fed is going to need to raise rates higher, and hold them higher for longer, than people currently expect and this is going to cause markets to go through some significant volatility as stock and bond markets are priced for benign scenarios and not the more difficult one that we are headed towards.

This brought income up to $11.3 billion and $934 million, respectively, over the six-month period to 31 December 2022. Additionally, revenue was also up 7.6 per cent, to $11.3 billion. This is a turnaround compared to the same time last year when Telstra reported year-on-year declines in income, revenue and profit , which at the time was chalked up to the decline in National Broadband Network (NBN) payment receipts during the period.

Bob Hawke was prime minister, Crocodile Dundee II came out, Steve Jobs' NeXTcube made its debut and this was considered a mobile phone . A lot has changed since 1988, yet the laws that govern how our privacy needs to be protected have not (save for a handful of amendments here and there). It's therefore no surprise the Australian government wants to overhaul the Privacy Act. Back in October 2020, Australia's then Attorney-General Christian Porter officially kicked off a review into the Privacy Act.

[3 independent proofs that quantum fields carry energy](https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/quantum-fields-energy/)


> xml encoding="utf-8" ? One of the biggest questions that appears right at the intersection of physics and philosophy is as simple as it is puzzling: what is real? Is reality simply described by the particles that exist, atop a background of spacetime described by General Relativity? Is it fundamentally wrong to describe these entities as particles, and must we consider them as some sort of hybrid wave/particle/probability function: a more complete description of each 'quantum' in our reality? Or are there fields, fundamentally, that underpin all of existence, where the 'quanta' that we typically interact with are simply examples of excitations of those fields? When quantum mechanics arrived on the scene, it brought with it the realization that quantities that had previously thought to be well-defined, like: the position and momentum of a particle, its energy and location in time, and its angular momentum in each of the three spatial dimensions that we have, could no longer be assigned values, only a probability distribution for what values they could take on.
