> While there are plenty of espresso makers out in the market, it's rare that you see a machine dedicated to making Turkish coffee. If you're a fan of this thick, strong brew, then the Beko Telvo Duo Turkish Coffee Machine is definitely something to have in your kitchen.What's impressive about it is that it makes enough Turkish coffee to serve six people, and while that might be great for larger gatherings, it's a bit of overkill if you just occasionally want a single cup. This also means that the machine is larger than most single-brew machines, so you'll need to have enough counter space to keep it handy.

During the Apple event, we got a new entry-level iPad, iPad mini 6, Apple Watch Series 7, and iPhone 13. While the Series 7 and iPhone 13 were definitely expected, I believe most of us were shocked that Apple decided to start off with the new iPad lineup. While there were plenty of rumors for the new iPad mini, I don't think there were as many for the base-level iPad, which kicked off the event.

> I wasn't sure what to expect from Kena: Bridge of Spirits. Developer Ember Lab's adorable adventure caused quite a stir when it was revealed at the PlayStation Future of Gaming showcase in 2020 Following a delay, it felt like Kena retreated into the shadows a bit - leaving some anxiety about whether it would still meet its new release date of September 21, and whether it would fall at the final hurdle many highly-anticipated releases have in the last couple of years.Developing a game in the current climate is a heavy cross to bear, particularly for a smaller studio like Ember.

> Source: Android Central I previewed Kena: Bridge of Spirits shortly before E3 2021. At the time, I only had an hour or so with the game, but felt confident that it was shaping up to be something special. After spending some more time with the final build, I'm happy that my initial impressions appear to be right. I haven't wanted to put the controller down since I started. Kena's characters and world hold such a charm that it's hard not to love them, and the gameplay continues to evolve throughout so that progression feels natural and earned.

Many models simply bump around, chaotically criss-crossing your floors until their battery runs low. This can result in clean floors, but you may find random spots that the vacuum completely missed, and these more basic robot vacuums may not always find their way back to their charging base to be ready for the next job (which could be needed right away if it missed a lot of spots).

> The Far Cry series has been no stranger to controversy. From criticism over Far Cry 4's cover art to the petition over Far Cry 5's portrayal of religious fanatics as villains, Ubisoft's long-running series is often contentious, to say the least, and Far Cry 6 is no different.Set on the fictional island of Yara, Far Cry 6 sees players taking on the role of Dani Rojas, who joins a guerrilla revolution against Yara's tyrannical dictator, Anton Castillo (played by Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito). It's a dark premise, but one that Ubisoft plans to balance with the chaotic, playground mechanics that the Far Cry series is known for – a balancing act that has already garnered criticism from some.

Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey recently analyzed seeds stuck in the footprints to determine their approximate age, ranging from around 22,800 and 21,130 years ago.The findings may shed light on a mystery that has long intrigued scientists: When did people first arrive in the Americas, after dispersing from Africa and Asia?Most scientists believe ancient migration came by way of a now-submerged land bridge that connected Asia to Alaska.

> It's time to take the first look at the recently introduced iPhone 13 series. The phones go on sale in India from today although we hear and see that the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max may hit the market only in limited quantity. Now, before we talk about the phones just a line about their prices: Just like last year, this year also we saw four new iPhones iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. The price starts from Rs 69,990 and goes up to Rs 1,79,990. I briefly tried all four new iPhone models and while the design language remains more or less same, there are some incremental changes both to the overall aesthetics and on the hardware front.
