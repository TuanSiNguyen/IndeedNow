> While there are plenty of espresso makers out in the market, it's rare that you see a machine dedicated to making Turkish coffee. If you're a fan of this thick, strong brew, then the Beko Telvo Duo Turkish Coffee Machine is definitely something to have in your kitchen.What's impressive about it is that it makes enough Turkish coffee to serve six people, and while that might be great for larger gatherings, it's a bit of overkill if you just occasionally want a single cup. This also means that the machine is larger than most single-brew machines, so you'll need to have enough counter space to keep it handy.

During the Apple event, we got a new entry-level iPad, iPad mini 6, Apple Watch Series 7, and iPhone 13. While the Series 7 and iPhone 13 were definitely expected, I believe most of us were shocked that Apple decided to start off with the new iPad lineup. While there were plenty of rumors for the new iPad mini, I don't think there were as many for the base-level iPad, which kicked off the event.

> I wasn't sure what to expect from Kena: Bridge of Spirits. Developer Ember Lab's adorable adventure caused quite a stir when it was revealed at the PlayStation Future of Gaming showcase in 2020 Following a delay, it felt like Kena retreated into the shadows a bit - leaving some anxiety about whether it would still meet its new release date of September 21, and whether it would fall at the final hurdle many highly-anticipated releases have in the last couple of years.Developing a game in the current climate is a heavy cross to bear, particularly for a smaller studio like Ember.

> Source: Android Central I previewed Kena: Bridge of Spirits shortly before E3 2021. At the time, I only had an hour or so with the game, but felt confident that it was shaping up to be something special. After spending some more time with the final build, I'm happy that my initial impressions appear to be right. I haven't wanted to put the controller down since I started. Kena's characters and world hold such a charm that it's hard not to love them, and the gameplay continues to evolve throughout so that progression feels natural and earned.

I believe in more voices, not less. To be successful, the technology and the organization policy must align and be open to all.

Many models simply bump around, chaotically criss-crossing your floors until their battery runs low. This can result in clean floors, but you may find random spots that the vacuum completely missed, and these more basic robot vacuums may not always find their way back to their charging base to be ready for the next job (which could be needed right away if it missed a lot of spots).
